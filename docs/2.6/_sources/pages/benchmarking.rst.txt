Video and Time-series Benchmarking Tool
========================================

Suggested Physical Setup: 

*	Test setup calls 2 systems on the network. 

    *	System 1 - **Traffic generator**. This is where Intel supplied bash scripts to run. Alternately, system 1 can be replaced with more than 1 RTSP cameras to generate multi stream video traffic.   
    *	System 2 - The System Under Test (SUT), this is where EII containers are running
