EII Configuration Management
=============================

etcd
=====

EII uses etcd (https://etcd.io/) for configuration management. etcd acts as a distributed key-value store for distributed systems. EII applications will contact etcd on startup and read their configurations as set by the user using the provisioning step/etcd UI. Because etcd is distributed, applications can receive their configuration on any node in the etcd cluster, regardless of where they might be deployed.

Select **etcdkeeper** directory

Tool to Generate Configuration Management UI Service
====================================================

By default, after the user provision EII on the edge devices, the configMgr UI service will follow the default configuration on the **eii_config.json**. Below is the example on changing configuration on ConfigMgr UI and how to save the data back to json format. 

#. Browse the ConfigMgr UI Service as mention at EII Configuration Management Web UI Service Section.

#. Perform the changes, below example of changing the filter parameter to using **dummy** filter instead of using the default filter.  

#. For capturing the data back from ETCD Cluster to Json file, run below command
    
    $  cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision/
    
    $  ./etcd_capture.sh

#.	
  Below is the example of  **[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision**  before running the script.
