Purpose of Telegraf
-------------------

Telegraf is one of the data entry points for IEdgeInsights. It supports many input plugins, which can be used for
point data ingestion. In the above example, the MQTT input plugin of Telegraf is used. And below is the configuration
of the plugin.

.. code-block::

   ```
   # # Read metrics from MQTT topic(s)
   [[inputs.mqtt_consumer]]
   #   ## MQTT broker URLs to be used. The format should be scheme://host:port,
   #   ## schema can be tcp, ssl, or ws.
       servers = ["tcp://localhost:1883"]
   #
   #   ## MQTT QoS, must be 0, 1, or 2
   #   qos = 0
   #   ## Connection timeout for initial connection in seconds
   #   connection_timeout = "30s"
   #
   #   ## Topics to subscribe to
       topics = [
       "temperature/simulated/0",
       ]
       name_override = "point_data"
       data_format = "json"
   #
   #   # if true, messages that can't be delivered while the subscriber is offline
   #   # will be delivered when it comes back (such as on service restart).
   #   # NOTE: if true, client_id MUST be set
       persistent_session = false
   #   # If empty, a random client ID will be generated.
       client_id = ""
   #
   #   ## username and password to connect MQTT server.
       username = ""
       password = ""
   ```
