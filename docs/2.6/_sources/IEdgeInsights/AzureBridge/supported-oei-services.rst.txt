Supported OEI Services
----------------------

Azure Bridge supports the following services:


* Config Manager Agent
* Video Ingestion
* Video Analytics

.. note:: 


   * As ``Config Manager Agent`` responsible for OEI provisioning is deployed as azure module, it becomes essential to have other OEI services to be deployed as azure modules to talk to other OEI azure modules.
   * Ensure to add the app names to the ``SERVICES`` environment key of ``Config Manager Agent`` module template file at `ia_configmgr_agent.template.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/ia_configmgr_agent.template.json>`_.
