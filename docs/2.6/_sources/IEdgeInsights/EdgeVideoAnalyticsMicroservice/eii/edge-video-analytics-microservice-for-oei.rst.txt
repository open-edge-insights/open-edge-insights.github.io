Edge Video Analytics Microservice for OEI
-----------------------------------------

The Edge Video Analytics Microservice (EVAM) combines video ingestion and analytics
capabilities provided by Open Edge Insights (OEI) visual ingestion and analytics modules.
This directory provides the Intel® Deep Learning Streamer (Intel® DL Streamer) pipelines
to perform object detection on an input URI source and send the ingested frames and
inference results using the MsgBus Publisher. It also provides a Docker compose
and config file to use EVAM with the Open Edge Insights software stack.
