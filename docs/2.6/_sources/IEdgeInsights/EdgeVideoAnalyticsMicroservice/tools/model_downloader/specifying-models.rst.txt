Specifying Models
=================

Models are specified using a yaml file containing a list of model
entries. Model entries can either be strings (model names) or objects
(model names plus additional properties) and a single yaml file can
contain both forms of entries. An `example file <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/models.list.yml>`_ is used as part of the
default build process.
