Linking
-------

It is recommended to link to the library using the CMake build system. To do
this you must use the ``find_package()`` method in CMake to find and include the
package.

The example below showcases how this can be accomplished.

.. code-block:: cmake

   # Find the package
   find_package(EIIUtils REQUIRED)

   # Add the include directories
   include_directories(${EIIUtils_INCLUDE})

   # Link to your executable (NOTE: 'src/example.cpp' is just an example path)
   add_executable(example "src/example.cpp")
   target_link_libraries(example ${EIIUtils_LIBRARIES})
