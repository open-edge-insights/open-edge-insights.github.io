Installation
------------

.. note::  This is a mandatory step to use this library in
   C/C++ EII modules


If you wish to install this library on your system, execute the
following command after building the library:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo make install

By default, this command will install the ``udfloader`` library into
``/usr/local/lib/``. On some platforms this is not included in the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``
by default. As a result, you must add this directory to you ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``. This can
be accomplished with the following ``export``\ :

.. code-block:: sh

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/

.. note::  You can also specify a different library prefix to CMake through
   the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` flag.
