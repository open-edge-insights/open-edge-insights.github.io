Running Unit Tests
------------------

.. note::  The unit tests will only be compiled if the ``WITH_TESTS=ON`` option
   is specified when running CMake.


Run the following commands from the ``build/tests`` folder to cover the unit
tests.

.. code-block:: sh

   # First, source the source.sh file to setup the PYTHONPATH environment
   $ source ./source.sh

   # Execute frame abstraction unit tests
   $ ./frame-tests

   # Execute UDF loader unit tests
   $ ./udfloader-tests
