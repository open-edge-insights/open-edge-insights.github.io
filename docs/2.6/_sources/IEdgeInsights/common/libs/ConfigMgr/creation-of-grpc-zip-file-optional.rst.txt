Creation of grpc .zip file (Optional)
-------------------------------------

**Note**\ : This is an optional as we have already created .zip file in the repo.
If user wants to create .zip file freshly, then one has to follow this step.

Navigate to ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr`` and run the ``grpc_zip.sh``

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo ./grpc_zip.sh

By executing the above script grpc zip package will be created in
``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr``.
