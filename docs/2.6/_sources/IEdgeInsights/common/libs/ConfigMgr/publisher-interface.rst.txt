     - Type
     - Required (Mandatory)
     - Description
   * - ``Publishers``
     - ``array``
     - Yes

     - Yes
     - Name of different publisher interfaces

   * - ``EndPoint``
     - ``string`` or ``object``
     - Yes
     - In case of TCP or IPC (socket directory only), endpoint should be string as shown in the above examples.
