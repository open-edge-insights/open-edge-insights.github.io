Running Unit Tests
------------------

.. note:: 



* 
  The unit tests will only be compiled if the ``WITH_TESTS=ON`` option is specified when running CMake.
  Please refer `Unit Test installation <#-install-configmgr-with-examples,-test-suits-and-debug-build-enabled.>`__ installation.

  Provisioning should be done to start etcd server in dev/prod mode and to generate application specific certificates(only in prod mode).

Before executing any of the test files, please run below command from ``build/tests/``

.. code-block:: sh

    cd ../../examples/ && source ./env.sh && cd -


* To run ConfigMgr unit tests
