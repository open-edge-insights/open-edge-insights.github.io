Build EII stack
---------------

.. note:: 


   #. This step is optional if one wants to use the EII pre-built
      container images itself and doesn't want to build from source.
      For more details, refer: `Distribution of EII container images <#distribution-of-eii-container-images>`__
   #. Base EII services like ia_eiibase, ia_video_common etc., are required only at the build time and not at
      the runtime.


Builds all EII services in the ``build/docker-compose-build.yml`` along with the base EII services.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build

If any of the services fails during build, it can be built using below command

.. code-block:: sh

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build --no-cache <service name>
