ConfigManagerAgent
==================

ConfigMgrAgent is a EII service responsible for below:


* Generates the required config manager data store keys/certificates to interact with 
  EII config manager data store like etcd and puts in the volume mounts to be shared with
  other EII services in PROD mode
* Generates the required messagebus keys required for communication in PROD mode
* Puts the EII services configs to EII config manager data store

The diagram below shows a high level flow of ``ConfigMgrAgent`` service .

       ConfigMgrAgent->>ETCD: Load default configuration
       ConfigMgrAgent->>ETCD: Generate and load ZeroMQ Keys
       ConfigMgrAgent->>EIIService: Copy ETCD certificates to the shared volume
       Note right of ConfigMgrAgent: Each service has its own certs volume
       EIIService->>ETCD: Connect to ETCD with certificate to get configuration

.. note::  Any EII service ``waits/restarts`` if the config manager data store client key
   and certificates are yet to be made available for the container.
