VideoAnalytics Module
=====================

The VideoAnalytics module is mainly responsibly for running the classifier UDFs
and doing the required inferencing on the chosen Intel(R) Hardware
(CPU, GPU, VPU, HDDL) using openVINO.

The high level logical flow of VideoAnalytics pipeline is as below:


#. App reads the application configuration via EII Configuration Manager which
   has details of ``encoding`` and ``udfs``.
#. App gets the msgbus endpoint configuration from system environment.
#. Based on above two configurations, app subscribes to the published topic/stream
   coming from VideoIngestion module.
#. The frames received in the subscriber are passed onto one or more chained
   native/python UDFs for running inferencing and doing any post-processing as
   required. One can refer `UDFs README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/blob/master/udfs/README.md>`_ for more details
#. The frames coming out of chained udfs are published on the different topic/stream
   on EII MessageBus.
