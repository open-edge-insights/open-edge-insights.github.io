Generating consolidated deployment and configuration files:
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: 


   #. Whenever we make changes to individual EII app/service directories files as mentioned above in the description column
        or in the `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ file, it is required to re-run the ``builder.py`` script before provisioning and running
        the EII stack to ensure that the changes done reflect in the required consolidated files.
   #. Manual editing of above consolidated files is not recommended and we would recommend to do the required changes to
        respective files in EII app/service directories and use `build/builder.py <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/builder.py>`_ script to generate the conslidated ones.
   #. This `eii_config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/provision/config/eii_config.json>`_ script removes the subscriber or client interface for EII service/app(s) configuration in consolidated `eii_config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/provision/config/eii_config.json>`_
        if the corresponding publisher or server interface in any EII service/app(s) is missing based on the default ``builder.py`` execution or ``builder.py`` execution with ``-f`` switch.
        **Please note if one runs into issues where the DNS server is being overwhelmed with DNS queries for the EII service/app name, most likely this would be happening if those EII services are intentionally
        stopped, please ensure to restart those EII services/app(s). If the intention is to not have that application/service running, please execute the ``builder.py`` by providing usecase yml file with that application/service not
        listed, so the corresponding subscriber/client interfaces from other EII service/app(s) are automatically removed before provisioning and deployment of EII stack. Please check
        `#running-builder-to-generate-the-above-listed-consolidated-files-for-a-subset-of-eii-services <#running-builder-to-generate-the-above-listed-consolidated-files-for-a-subset-of-eii-services>`__ for selectively choosing required
        EII services**


EII is equipped with `builder <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/builder.py>`_\ , a robust python tool to auto-generate the required configuration files to deploy EII services on single/multiple nodes. The tool is    capable of auto-generating the following consolidated files by fetching the respective files from EII service directories which are required to bring up different EII use-cases:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - file name
     - Description
   * - docker-compose.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose.yml`` file used to launch EII docker containers in a given single node using ``docker-compose`` tool
   * - docker-compose.override.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose-dev.override.yml`` of every app that is generated only in DEV mode for EII deployment on a given single node using ``docker-compose`` tool
   * - docker-compose-build.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose-build.yml`` file having EII base images and ``depends_on`` and ``build`` keys required for building EII services
   * - docker-compose-push.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose-push.yml`` file (same as ``docker-compose.yml`` file with just dummy ``build`` key added), used for pushing EII services to docker registry
   * - eii_config.json
     - Consolidated ``config.json`` of every app which will be put into etcd during provisioning
   * - values.yaml
     - Consolidated ``values.yaml`` of every app inside helm-eii/eii-deploy directory, which is required to deploy EII services via helm
   * - Template yaml files
     - Files copied from helm/templates directory of every app to helm-eii/eii-deploy/templates directory, which are required to deploy EII services via helm
