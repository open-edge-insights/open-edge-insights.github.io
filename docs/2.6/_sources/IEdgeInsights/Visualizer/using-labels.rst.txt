Using Labels
------------

  In order to have the visualizer label each of the defects on the image, labels in JSON format(with mapping between topic subscribed text to be displayed) has to be provided in `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-native-visualizer/blob/master/config.json>`_ file and run the `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-native-visualizer/blob/master/config.json>`_ script using the below command.

.. code-block:: sh

     $ python3 builder.py

  An example of what this JSON value should look like is shown below. In this case
  it is assumed that the classification types are ``0`` and ``1`` and the text labels
  to be displayed are ``MISSING`` and ``SHORT`` respectively.

.. code-block:: json

     {
         "0": "MISSING",
         "1": "SHORT"
     }

.. note::  These labels are the mapping for the PCB demo provided in EII's visualizer directory. Currently camera1_stream_results consists of pcb demo labeling and camera2_stream_results consists of safety demo labeling.
     Hence, in `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-native-visualizer/blob/master/config.json>`_ proper mapping of all the subscribed topics should be done with pcb demo labeling and safety demo labeling respectively.
