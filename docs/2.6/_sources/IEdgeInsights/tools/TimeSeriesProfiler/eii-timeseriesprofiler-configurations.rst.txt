EII TimeSeriesProfiler configurations
-------------------------------------


#. 
   total_number_of_samples

    If mode is set to 'sps', the average SPS is calculated for the number of samples set by this variable.
    If mode is set to 'monitor', the average stats is calculated for the number of samples set by this variable.
    Setting it to (-1) will run the profiler forever unless terminated by stopping container TimeSeriesProfiler manually.
    total_number_of_samples should never be set as (-1) for 'sps' mode.

#. 
   export_to_csv

    Setting this switch to **true** exports csv files for the results obtained in TimeSeriesProfiler. For monitor_mode, runtime stats printed in the csv
    are based on the the following precdence: avg_stats, per_sample_stats, display_metadata.
