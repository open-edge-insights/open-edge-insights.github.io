EII TimeSeriesProfiler modes
----------------------------

.. code-block::

   By default the EII TimeSeriesProfiler supports two modes, which are 'sps' & 'monitor' mode.



#. 
   SPS mode

    Enabled by setting the 'mode' key in `config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/TimeSeriesProfiler/config.json>`_ to 'sps', this mode calculates the samples
    per second of any EII module by subscribing to that module's respective stream.

   .. code-block:: sh

           "mode": "sps"

#. 
   Monitor mode

    Enabled by setting the 'mode' key in `config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/TimeSeriesProfiler/config.json>`_ to 'monitor', this mode calculates average & per sample stats

    Refer the below exmaple config where TimeSeriesProfiler is used in monitor mode.

   .. code-block:: javascript

           "config": {
           "mode": "monitor",
           "monitor_mode_settings": {
                                       "display_metadata": false,
                                       "per_sample_stats":false,
                                       "avg_stats": true
                                   },
           "total_number_of_samples" : 5,
           "export_to_csv" : false
       }

   .. code-block:: sh

           "mode": "monitor"

    The stats to be displayed by the tool in monitor_mode can be set in the monitor_mode_settings key of `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/TimeSeriesProfiler/config.json>`_.


   #. 'display_metadata': Displays the raw meta-data with timestamps associated with every sample.
   #. 'per_sample_stats': Continously displays the per sample metrics of every sample.
   #. 'avg_stats': Continously displays the average metrics of every sample.

   ..

      **Note:**


      * Pre-requisite for running in profiling or monitor mode: Time series containers should be running with PROFILING_MODE set to **true** in `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_
      * For running TimeSeriesProfiler in SPS mode, it is recommended to keep PROFILING_MODE set to false in `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ for better performance.
