About tool
==========


* This tool acts as a brokered publisher of EII messagebus.
* Telegaf's eii messagebus input plugin acts as a subscriber to the EII broker.

How to integrate this tool with video/timeseries use case.
==========================================================


* In 'time-series.yml'/'video-streaming.yml' file, please add 'ZmqBroker' and 'tools/EmbPublisher' components.
* Use the modified  'time-series.yml'/'video-streaming.yml' file as an argument while generating the docker-compose.yml file using the 'builder.py' utility.
* Follow usual provisioning and starting process.

Configuration of the tool.
==========================

Let us look at the sample configuration

.. code-block::

   {
     "config": {
       "pub_name": "TestPub",
       "msg_file": "data1k.json",
       "iteration": 10,
       "interval": "5ms"
     },
     "interfaces": {
       "Publishers": [
         {
           "Name": "TestPub",
           "Type": "zmq_tcp",
           "AllowedClients": [
             "*"
           ],
           "EndPoint": "ia_zmq_broker:60514",

             "topic-pfx2",
             "topic-pfx3",
             "topic-pfx4"
           ],
           "BrokerAppName" : "ZmqBroker",

           ],
           "EndPoint": {
                   "SocketDir": "/EII/sockets",
                   "SocketFile": "frontend-socket"
               },
           "Topics": [
