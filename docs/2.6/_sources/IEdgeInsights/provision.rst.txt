Provision
=========

:raw-html-m2r:`<b>By default EII is provisioned in Secure mode</b>`.

Follow below steps to provision. Provisioning must be done before deploying EII on any node. It will start ETCD as a container and load it with configuration required to run EII for single node or multi node cluster set up.

Please follow below steps to provision in Developer mode. Developer mode will have all security disabled.


* Please update DEV_MODE=true in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ to provision in Developer mode.
* Please re-run the `build/builder.py <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/builder.py>`_ to re-generate the consolidated files as mentioned above

Following actions will be performed as part of Provisioning


* Loading initial ETCD values from json file located at ``build/provision/config/eii_config.json``.
* For Secure mode only, Generating ZMQ secret/public keys for each app and putting them in ETCD.
* Generating required X509 certs and putting them in etcd.
* All server certificates will be generated with 127.0.0.1, localhost and HOST_IP mentioned in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_.
* If HOST_IP is blank in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_\ , then HOST_IP will be automatically detected when server certificates are generated.

**Optional:** In case of any errors during provisioning w.r.t existing volumes, please remove the existing volumes by running the EII uninstaller script: `eii_uninstaller.sh <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/eii_uninstaller.sh>`_

Run all the below commands in this section from ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision`` directory.

Below script starts ``etcd`` as a container and provision. Please pass docker-compose file as argument, against which provisioning will be done.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
   $ sudo -E ./provision.sh <path_to_eii_docker_compose_file>

   $ # eq. $ sudo -E ./provision.sh ../docker-compose.yml

..

   **Optional**\ : By default, the provisioning step will pull the provisioning images from docker registry. In case the user wants to build the images, ``--build`` flag should be provided in the provisioning command i.e.

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ sudo -E ./provision.sh <path_to_eii_docker_compose_file> --build
      $ # eq. $ sudo -E ./provision.sh ../docker-compose.yml --build

   **Note**
   The above command only ``build`` the provisioining images, will not do any other functions of provisioning script.


**Optional:** For capturing the data back from Etcd to a JSON file, run the `etcd_capture.sh <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/provision/etcd_capture.sh>`_ script. This can be achieved using the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ./etcd_capture.sh
