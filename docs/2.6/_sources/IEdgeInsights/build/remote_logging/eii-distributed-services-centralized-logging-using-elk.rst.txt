EII distributed services centralized logging using ELK
======================================================

"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts and graphs in Elasticsearch.

The guide below demonstrates how the logs of EII services running in distributed environment can be centralized via ELK stack. It allows you to search all the logs in a single place.
