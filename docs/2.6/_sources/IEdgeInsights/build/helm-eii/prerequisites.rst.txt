Prerequisites
-------------

**Note**\ :


* K8s installation on single or multi node should be done as pre-requisite to continue the following deployment. Please note we
   have tried the kubernetes cluster setup with ``kubeadm``\ , ``kubectl`` and ``kubelet`` packages on single and multi nodes with ``v1.23.4``.
   One can refer tutorials like https://adamtheautomator.com/install-kubernetes-ubuntu/#Installing_Kubernetes_on_the_Master_and_Worker_Nodes and many other
   online tutorials to setup kubernetes cluster on the web with host OS as ubuntu 18.04/20.04.
* For helm installation, please refer `helm website <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>`_

..

   For time series usecase make sure ia_mqtt_broker & ia_mqtt_publisher are running.
   Make sure 'MQTT_BROKER_HOST' Environment Variable is updated with HOST IP address of the system where MQTT Broker is running.


For preparing the necessary files required for the provision and deployment, user needs to execute the build and provision steps on an Ubuntu 18.04 / 20.04 machine.
Follow the Docker prerequisites, OEI Prerequisites, Provision OEI and Build and Run OEI mentioned in `README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md>`_ on the Ubuntu dev machine.

  As OEI don't distribute all the docker images on docker hub, one would run into issues of those pods status showing ``ImagePullBackOff`` and few pods status like visualizer, factory ctrl etc.,
  showing ``CrashLoopBackOff`` due to additional configuration required. For ``ImagePullBackOff`` issues, please follow the steps mentioned at [../README.md#distribution-of-eii-container-images]> (../README.
  md#distribution-of-eii-container-images) to push the images that are locally built to the docker registry of choice. Ensure to update the ``DOCKER_REGISTRY`` value in ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env``
  file and re-run the `../builder.py <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/builder.py>`_ script to regenerate the helm charts for provision and deployment.
