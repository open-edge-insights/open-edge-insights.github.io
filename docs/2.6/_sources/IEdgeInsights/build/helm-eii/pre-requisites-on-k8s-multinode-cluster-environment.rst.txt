Pre requisites on K8s MultiNode Cluster Environment
---------------------------------------------------

.. note:: 


   * For running OEI in Prod Mode, it is required to have self-signed certificates that are getting generated need to go in as kubernetes secrets. To make this happen, it is mandatory that ConfigManager Agent Pod & generating Certs Pod gets scheduled in k8s Cluster's Master/Control Plane node
   * By default, OEI deployment charts are deployed in PROD mod and only ConfigManager Agent & generating Certs pods gets scheduled on Master/Control Plane node of K8s Cluster
   * Ensure that the Master Node is *tainted* to schedule the pod


.. code-block:: sh

     kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/master-
