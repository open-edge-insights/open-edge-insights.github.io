Select EII services to run on a particular node in multinode deployment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


* 
  Edit ``vars/vars.yml`` -> under ``nodes`` add a specific a node which was defined in the inventory file(\ ``hosts``\ ) and add EII services to ``include_services`` list

    Eg. if you want leader to run ia_video_ingestion, ``vars/vars.yml`` should be

  .. code-block:: yml

           nodes:
             leader:
               include_services:
                   - ia_video_ingestion

* 
  If you want to add ``worker1`` to ``nodes`` and bring up ``ia_visualizer`` in ``worker1``\ :

  .. code-block:: yml

       nodes:
         leader:
           include_services:
               - ia_video_ingestion
         worker1:
           include_services:
               - ia_visualizer

.. note:: 
   If a service is not added to ``include_services`` list, that service will not deployed on a particular node
