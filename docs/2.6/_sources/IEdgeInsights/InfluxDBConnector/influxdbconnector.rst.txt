InfluxDBConnector
=================

InfluxDBConnector service stores the timeseries/video metadata received over the EII messagebus to InfluxDB database.

The high level logical flow of InfluxDBConnector service is as below:


#. InfluxDBConnector service will subscribe to the InfluxDB and start the EII messagebus
   publisher, EII messagebus subscriber threads, and EII messagebus request reply thread
   based on PubTopics, SubTopics and QueryTopics configuration.
#. EII messagebus subscriber thread connects to the PUB socket of messagebus on which
   the data is published by VideoAnalytics and push it to the InfluxDB
#. EII messagebus publisher thread will publish the point data ingested by the telegraf
   and the classifier result coming out of the point data analytics.
#. EII messagebus reply request service will receive the InfluxDB select query and
   response with the historical data.
