Execute queries
---------------

On the ``Point_Data_Dashboard``\ , the green spikes visible in the graph are the results of the default query. To run queries, perform the following steps:


#. 
   In the **FROM** section of query, click **default_classifier_results**. A list is displayed with the name of measurements present in InfluxDB.

   ..

      **Note:** If any other measurement is set the graph will switch to the measurement query results.
      By default, the **FROM** section will have **default point_classifier_results WHERE +**.


#. 
   In the **SELECT** section, click **temperature**. A list will display the fields tags present in the schema of the measurements set in the **FROM** section.

   ..

      **Note:** By default the **SELECT** section will have **field(temperature) mean() +**.
      The graph will change according to the values you select.
