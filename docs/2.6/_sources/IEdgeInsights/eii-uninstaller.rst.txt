EII Uninstaller
===============

The uninstaller script automates the removal of all the EII Docker configuration installed on a system. This uninstaller will perform the following tasks:


#. **Stops and removes all EII running and stopped containers**
#. **Removes all EII docker volumes**
#. **Removes all EII docker images [Optional]**
#. **Removes all EII install directory**

Run the below commmand from ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/`` directory.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ./eii_uninstaller.sh -h
   Usage: ./eii_uninstaller.sh [-h] [-d]

    This script uninstalls previous EII version.
    Where:
       -h show the help
       -d triggers the deletion of docker images (by default it will not trigger)

    Example:
     1) Deleting only EII Containers and Volumes
       $ ./eii_uninstaller.sh

     2) Deleting EII Containers, Volumes and Images
       $ export EII_VERSION=2.4
       $ ./eii_uninstaller.sh -d
       above example will delete EII containers, volumes and all the docker images having 2.4 version.
