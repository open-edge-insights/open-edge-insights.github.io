Adding custom udfs in VideoIngestion/VideoAnalytics:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. 
   **For python udfs:** Copy udf code to ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/python`` directory

    Refer the below example to copy the python safety gear udf (For this example python safety_gear udf can be copied from [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/CustomUdfs/PySafetyGearAnalytics):

    $ cp -r :raw-html-m2r:`<PATH>`\ /safety_gear [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/python

.. code-block::

   **For native udfs:** Copy udf code to `[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/native` directory

   Refer the below example to copy the native safety gear udf (For this example native safety_gear_demo udf can be copied from [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/CustomUdfs/NativeSafetyGearAnalytics):

   $ cp -r <PATH>/safety_gear [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/native




#. 
   Make sure the appropriate ingestion config for the udf is set. In case one needs to use a video file then copy the video file to ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/test_videos``  and make the config changes.

    Refer the below example to copy ``Safety_Full_Hat_and_Vest.avi`` video to ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/test_videos``

    $ cp -r :raw-html-m2r:`<PATH>`\ Safety_Full_Hat_and_Vest.avi [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/test_videos

    In [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/config.json make the below changes to use ``Safety_Full_Hat_and_Vest.avi`` video file for safety_gear udf

   .. code-block:: javascript

       ----snip----
        "ingestor": {
               "type": "opencv",
               "pipeline": "./test_videos/Safety_Full_Hat_and_Vest.avi",
               "loop_video": true,
               "queue_size": 10,
               "poll_interval": 0.2
           },

#. 
   Make the required config changes to add the udfs.

   **For python udfs:**

   Refer the below example to make the required config changes for python safety gear udf:

   In ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/config.json`` or ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoAnalytics/config.json`` make the below changes to use safety_gear udf

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ----snip----
        "udfs": [
            {
               "device": "CPU",
               "model_bin": "common/video/udfs/python/safety_gear/ref/frozen_inference_graph.bin",
               "model_xml": "common/video/udfs/python//safety_gear/ref/frozen_inference_graph.xml",
               "name": "safety_gear.safety_classifier",
               "type": "python"

           }
        ]

   **For native udfs:**

   Refer the below example to make the required config changes for native safety gear udf:

   In ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/config.json`` or ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoAnalytics/config.json`` make the below changes to use safety_gear udf

   .. code-block:: javascript

      ----snip----
        "udfs": [
            {
               "device": "CPU",
               "model_bin": "common/video/udfs/native/safety_gear_demo/ref/frozen_inference_graph.bin",
               "model_xml": "common/video/udfs/native/safety_gear_demo/ref/frozen_inference_graph.xml",
               "name": "safety_gear_demo",
               "type": "native"

           }
        ]

   Note: The IR model files must be copied along with udfs

#. 
   For native udfs one needs to build it by modifying the ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/native/CMakeLists.txt`` file to add the subdirectory of the udf for build.

   Refer the below example to modify the ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/native/CMakeLists.txt`` to build the native safety_gear_demo

   .. code-block:: text

      ----snip----
      add_subdirectory(safety_gear_demo/)
      ----snip----

   Note: For custom udfs a CMakeLists.txt file needs to be created and must reside in the udf directory which is added as a subdirectory to ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/native/CMakeLists.txt`` file.

#. 
   Run builder and provision by refering ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/README.md``

#. 
   Build and run VideoIngestion & VideoAnalytics services.
