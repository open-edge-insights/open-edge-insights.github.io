Running unit tests
------------------

Unit tests are available under [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/DeploymentToolBackend/tests directory.
These can be executed using PyTest. 
To start with, user needs to install PyTest utility, if not already done.

Run the below command to install PyTest:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip3 install --user pytest

User also need to configure tests/config.ini with various values needed for the test.

For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   [backend]
   # IP address of the machine where backend is running
   ip = 127.0.0.1

   # Port at which backend is running. Please refer to the corresponding
   # docker-compose.yml to get the port value. Default value is 5100
   port = 5100

   # Backend login credentials.
   # Please refer to the correspnding creds.json to know the credentails.
   username = admin
   password = admin@123

   [deploy_target]
   # IP address of the machine where the remote deployment will be made.
   ip = 10.10.1.1

   # Credentails for the remote machine
   username = testuser
   password = testpassword

   # Directory path in the remote machine, where the deployment files will be copied.
   dir = /home/testuser/deploy

   # Docker image names of the services that will be copied to the remote machine.
   # At least one image name need to be specified
   images = ["openedgeinsights/ia_configmgr_agent:3.0"]

To run the unit tests, execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/DeploymentToolBackend/tests
   # pytest -v .

You may also run the tests individually. For e.g:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pytest -v test_basic.py
   # pytest -v test_build_deploy.py
