DEV MODE and PROFILING MODE
============================

DEV MODE
========

Starting the EII in Dev ModeDev mode eases the development phase for System Integrator (SI). This mode can be enabled by setting the environment variable dev_mode to **true** in the **[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env** file. The default value of this variable is **false**. 

Starting the EII in Dev Mode
----------------------------

All components will communicate over non-encrypted channels in dev mode. 

.. note::

    The user should not use this mode in a production environment because the security features have been disabled in this mode.


PROFILING MODE
==============

Profiling mode is used to gather performance statistics. In this mode, each EII component makes a record of the time needed for processing any single frame. These statistics are gathered in the visualizer where the SI can see the end-to-end processing time for individual frames, as well as the end-to-end average time. To enable profiling mode in EII, set the environment variable **PROFILING** in the **[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env** file to **true**. 

For each EII services defined in the **[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/docker-compose.yml** file, there is an ENV to determine whether **PROFILING** should be enabled based on the setting in the **[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env** file. Figure 52 provides an example from the Visualizer service.
