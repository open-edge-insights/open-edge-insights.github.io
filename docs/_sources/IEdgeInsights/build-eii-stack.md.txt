## Build EII stack

> **NOTE**:1. This step is optional if one wants to use the EII pre-built
>    container images itself and doesn't want to build from source.
>    For more details, refer: [Distribution of EII container images](#distribution-of-eii-container-images)
> 2. Base EII services like ia_eiibase, ia_video_common and others., are required only at the build time and not at
>    the runtime.

Builds all EII services in the [docker-compose-build.yml](build/docker-compose-build.yml) along with the base EII services.

```sh
$ xhost +
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build
```

If any of the services fails during build, it can be built using below command

```sh
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build --no-cache <service name>
```
