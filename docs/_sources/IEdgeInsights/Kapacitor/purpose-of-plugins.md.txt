## Purpose of plugins

  The plugins allow Kapacitor to interact directly with EII message bus. They use message bus publisher/subscriber
  interface. Using these plugins Kapacitor can now receive data from various EII publishers and send data 
  to various EII subscribers.
  Hence, it's possible to have a time-series use case without InfluxDB and Kapacitor can act as
  an independent analytical engine.

  A simple use case flow can be:

        MQTT-temp-sensor-->Telegraf-->Kapacitor-->TimeseriesProfiler
