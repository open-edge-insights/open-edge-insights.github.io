Install Open Edge Insights from GitHub
--------------------------------------

You can download and install OEI from the `Open Edge Insights GitHub repository <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_. For more information on manifest files, refer `Readme <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests/blob/master/README.md>`_.

To install OEI, perform the tasks in the following order:


* `Task 1: Get OEI codebase from GitHub <#task-1-get-oei-codebase-from-github>`__
* `Task 2: Install prerequisites <#task-2-install-prerequisites>`__
* `Task 3: Generate deployment and configuration files <#task-3-generate-deployment-and-configuration-files>`__
* `Task 4: Build and run the OEI video and time series use cases <#task-4-build-and-run-the-oei-video-and-time-series-use-cases>`__

Task 1: Get OEI codebase from GitHub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get the OEI codebase, complete the following steps:


#. 
   To install the repo tool, run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

       curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > repo
       sudo mv repo /bin/repo
       sudo chmod a+x /bin/repo

#. 
   To create a working directory, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

       mkdir -p <work-dir>

#. 
   To initialize the working directory using the repo tool, run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

       cd <work-dir>
       repo init -u "https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests.git"

#. 
   To pull all the projects mentioned in the manifest xml file, with the default or specific revision mentioned for each project, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

       repo sync

Task 2: Install prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``pre_requisites.sh`` script automates the installation and configuration of all the prerequisites required for building and running the OEI stack. The prerequisites are as follows:


* docker daemon
* docker client
* docker-compose
* Python packages

The ``pre-requisites.sh`` file performs the following:


* Checks if docker and docker-compose is installed in the system. If required, it uninstalls the older version and installs the correct version of docker and docker-compose.
* Configures the proxy settings for the docker client and docker daemon to connect to the internet.
* Configures the proxy settings system-wide (/etc/environment) and for docker. If a system is running behind a proxy, then the script prompts users to enter the proxy address to configure the proxy settings.
* Configures proxy setting for /etc/apt/apt.conf to enable apt updates and installations.

.. note:: 


   * The recommended version of the docker-compose is ``1.29.0``. In versions older than 1.29.0, the video use case docker-compose.yml files and the device_cgroup_rules command may not work.
   * To use versions older than docker-compose 1.29.0, in the ``ia_video_ingestion`` and ``ia_video_analytics`` services, comment out the ``device_cgroup_rules`` command.
   * 
     You can comment out the ``device_cgroup_rules`` command in the ``ia_video_ingestion`` and ``ia_video_analytics`` services to use versions older than 1.29.0 of docker-compose. This can result in limited inference and device support. The following code sample shows how the ``device_cgroup_rules`` commands are commented out:

     .. code-block:: sh

         ia_video_ingestion:
          ...
           #device_cgroup_rules:
              #- 'c 189:* rmw'
              #- 'c 209:* rmw'

   After modifying the ``docker-compose.yml`` file, refer to the ``Using the Builder script`` section. Before running the services using the ``docker-compose up`` command, rerun the ``builder.py`` script.


Run the pre-requisite script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the pre-requisite script, execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

       cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
       sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh --help
         Usage :: sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh [OPTION...]
         List of available options...
         --proxy         proxies, required when the gateway/edge node running OEI (or any of OEI profile) is connected behind proxy
         --help / -h         display this help and exit

.. note:: 

   If the --proxy option is not provided, then script will run without proxy. Different use cases are as follows:


   * 
     Runs without proxy

     .. code-block:: sh

           sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh

   * 
     Runs with proxy

     .. code-block:: sh

          sudo -E ./pre_requisites.sh --proxy="proxy.intel.com:891"


Optional steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* If required, you can enable full security for production deployments. Ensure that the host machine and docker daemon are configured per the security recommendation. For more info, see `build/docker_security_recommendation.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/docker_security_recommendation.md>`_.
* If required, you can enable log rotation for docker containers using any of the following methods:

Method 1
""""""""

Set the logging driver as part of the docker daemon. This applies to all the docker containers by default.


#. 
   Configure the json-file driver as the default logging driver. For more info, see `JSON File logging driver <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`_. The sample json-driver configuration which can be copied to ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` is as follows:

   .. code-block:: json

               {
                 "log-driver": "json-file",
                 "log-opts": {
                 "max-size": "10m",
                 "max-file": "5"
                 }
             }

#. 
   Run the following command to reload the docker daemon:

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo systemctl daemon-reload

#. 
   Run the following command to restart docker:

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo systemctl restart docker

Method 2
""""""""

Set logging driver as part of docker compose which is container specific. This overwrites the 1st option (i.e /etc/docker/daemon.json). The following example shows how to enable the logging driver only for the video_ingestion service:

.. code-block:: json

       ia_video_ingestion:
         ...
         ...
         logging:
           driver: json-file
           options:
           max-size: 10m
     max-file: 5

Task 3: Generate deployment and configuration files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After downloading OEI from the release package or Git, run the commands mentioned in this section from the ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/`` directory.

Use the Builder script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the Builder script, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

       python3 builder.py -h
       usage: builder.py [-h] [-f YML_FILE] [-v VIDEO_PIPELINE_INSTANCES]
                           [-d OVERRIDE_DIRECTORY]
       optional arguments:
           -h, --help            show this help message and exit
           -f YML_FILE, --yml_file YML_FILE
                               Optional config file for list of services to include.
                               Eg: python3 builder.py -f video-streaming.yml
                               (default: None)
           -v VIDEO_PIPELINE_INSTANCES, --video_pipeline_instances VIDEO_PIPELINE_INSTANCES
                               Optional number of video pipeline instances to be
                               created. Eg: python3 builder.py -v 6 (default:
                               1)
           -d OVERRIDE_DIRECTORY, --override_directory OVERRIDE_DIRECTORY
                               Optional directory consisting of benchmarking
                               configs to be present in each app directory. Eg:
                               python3 builder.py -d benchmarking (default:
                               None)

Generate consolidated files for all applicable OEI services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the Builder tool, OEI auto-generates the configuration files that are required for deploying the OEI services on a single or multiple nodes. The Builder tool auto-generates the consolidated files by getting the relevant files from the OEI service directories that are required for different OEI use-cases. The Builder tool parses the top-level directories under the ``IEdgeInsights`` directory to generate the consolidated files.

The following table shows the list of consolidated files and their details:

Table: Consolidated files

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - file name
     - Description
   * - docker-compose.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose.yml`` file used to launch OEI docker containers in each single node using the ``docker-compose`` tool
   * - docker-compose.override.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose-dev.override.yml`` of every app that is generated only in DEV mode for OEI deployment on a given single node using ``docker-compose`` tool
   * - docker-compose-build.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose-build.yml`` file having OEI base images and ``depends_on`` and ``build`` keys required for building OEI services
   * - docker-compose-push.yml
     - Consolidated ``docker-compose-push.yml`` file (same as ``docker-compose.yml`` file with just dummy ``build`` key added), used for pushing OEI services to docker registry
   * - eii_config.json
     - Consolidated ``config.json`` of every app which will be put into etcd during provisioning
   * - values.yaml
     - Consolidated ``values.yaml`` of every app inside helm-eii/eii-deploy directory, which is required to deploy OEI services via helm
   * - Template yaml files
     - Files copied from helm/templates directory of every app to helm-eii/eii-deploy/templates directory, which are required to deploy OEI services via helm


.. note:: 


   * If you modify an individual OEI app/service directory files, make sure to re-run the ``builder.py`` script before running the OEI stack to regenerate the updated consolidated files as above.
   * Manual editing of consolidated files is not recommended. Instead make changes to the respective files in the OEI app/service directories and use the ``builder.py`` script to generate the consolidated files.
   * Enter the secret credentials in the ``# Service credentials`` section of the `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ file if you are trying to run that OEI app/service. In case the required credentials are not present, the ``builder.py`` script would be prompting till all the required credentails are entered. Please protect this `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ file from being read by other users by applying a suitable file access mask.
   * The `builder_config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/builder_config.json>`_ is the config file for the ``builder.py`` script and it contains the following keys:

     * ``subscriber_list``\ : This key contains a list of services that act as a subscriber to the stream being published.
     * ``publisher_list``\ : This key contains a list of services that publishes a stream of data.
     * ``include_services``\ : This key contains the mandatory list of services that are required to be included when the Builder is run without the ``-f`` flag.
     * ``exclude_services``\ : This key contains the mandatory list of services that are required to be excluded when the Builder is run without the ``-f`` flag.
     * ``increment_rtsp_port``\ : This is a boolean key used for incrementing the port number for the RTSP stream pipelines.


To generate the consolidated files, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

     python3 builder.py

Generate consolidated files for a subset of OEI services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Builder uses a yml file for configuration. The config yml file consists of a list of services to include. You can mention the service name as the path relative to ``IEdgeInsights`` or full path to the service in the config yml file.
To include only a certain number of services in the OEI stack, you can add the -f or yml_file flag of builder.py. You can find the examples of yml files for different use cases as follows:


* 
  `Azure <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/usecases/video-streaming-azure.yml>`_

  The following example shows running Builder with the -f flag:

  .. code-block:: sh

          python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming.yml

* 
  **Main use cases**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Usecase

When you run the multi-instance config, a ``build/multi_instance`` directory is created in the build directory. Based on the number of ``video_pipeline_instances`` specified, that many directories of VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics is created in the ``build/multi_instance`` directory.

The following section provides an example for running the Builder to generate the multi-instance boiler plate config for 3 streams of **video-streaming** use case.

Generate multi-instance configs using the Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If required, you can generate the multi-instance ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``config.json`` files using the Builder. You can use the ``-v`` or ``video_pipeline_instances`` flag of the Builder to generate boiler plate config for the multiple -stream use cases. The ``-v`` or ``video_pipeline_instances`` flag creates the multi-stream boiler plate config for the ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``eii_config.json`` files.

The following example shows running builder to generate the multi-instance boiler plate config for 3 streams of video-streaming use case:

.. code-block:: sh

       python3 builder.py -v 3 -f usecases/video-streaming.yml

Using the previous command for 3 instances, the ``build/multi_instance`` directory consists of VideoIngestion1, VideoIngestion2, VideoIngestion3 and VideoAnalytics1, VideoAnalytics2, VideoAnalytics3 directories. Initially each directory will have the default ``config.json`` and the ``docker-compose.yml`` files that are present within the ``VideoIngestion`` and the ``VideoAnalytics`` directories.

.. code-block:: example

       ./build/multi_instance/
       |-- VideoAnalytics1
       |   |-- config.json
       |   `-- docker-compose.yml
       |-- VideoAnalytics2
       |   |-- config.json
       |   `-- docker-compose.yml
       |-- VideoAnalytics3
       |   |-- config.json
       |   `-- docker-compose.yml
       |-- VideoIngestion1
       |   |-- config.json
       |   `-- docker-compose.yml
       |-- VideoIngestion2
       |   |-- config.json
       |   `-- docker-compose.yml
       `-- VideoIngestion3
           |-- config.json
           `-- docker-compose.yml

 You can edit the configs of each of these streams within the ``build/multi_instance`` directory. To generate the consolidated ``docker compose`` and ``eii_config.json`` file, rerun the ``builder.py`` command.

.. note:: 


   * The multi-instance feature support of Builder works only for the video pipeline i.e., **usecases/video-streaming.yml** use case alone and not with any other use case yml files like **usecases/video-streaming-storage.yml** and so on. Also, it doesn't work for cases without the ``-f`` switch. The previous example will work with any positive number for ``-v``. To learn more about using the multi-instance feature with the DiscoverHistory tool, see `Multi-instance feature support for the builder script with the DiscoverHistory tool <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/DiscoverHistory/README.md#multi-instance-feature-support-for-the-builder-script-with-the-discoverhistory-tool>`_.
   * If you are running the multi-instance config for the first time, it is recommended to not change the default ``config.json`` file and the ``docker-compose.yml`` file in the ``VideoIngestion`` and ``VideoAnalytics`` directories.
   * If you are not running the multi-instance config for the first time, the existing ``config.json`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` files in the ``build/multi_instance`` directory will be used to generate the consolidated ``eii-config.json`` and ``docker-compose`` files.
   * The docker-compose.yml files present within the ``build/multi_instance`` directory will have the updated service_name, container_name, hostname, AppName, ports and secrets for that respective instance.
   * The config.json file in the ``build/multi_instance`` directory will have the updated Name, Type, Topics, Endpoint, PublisherAppname, ServerAppName and AllowedClients for the interfaces section and incremented rtsp port number for the config section of that respective instance.
   * Ensure that all the containers are down before running the multi-instance configuration. Run the ``docker-compose down`` command before running ``builder.py`` for the multi-instance configuration.


Generate benchmarking configs using Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the ``-d`` or the ``override_directory`` flag to provide a different set of ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``config.json`` files other than the existing files in every service directory. The ``-d`` or the ``override_directory`` flag indicates to search for the required set of files within a directory provided by the flag.
For example, to pick files from a directory named benchmarking, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

        python3 builder.py -d benchmarking

.. note:: 


   * If you use the override directory feature of the builder then include all the 3 files mentioned in the previous example. If you do not include a file in the override directory then the Builder will omit that service in the final config that is generated.
   * Adding the ``AppName`` of the subscriber or client container in the ``subscriber_list of builder_config.json`` allows you to spawn a single subscriber or client container that is subscribing or receiving on multiple publishers or server containers.
   * Multiple containers specified by the ``-v`` flag is spawned for services that are not mentioned in the ``subscriber_list``. For example, if you run Builder with ``–v 3`` option and ``Visualizer`` is not added in the ``subscriber_list`` of ``builder_config.json`` then 3 instances of Visualizer are spawned. Each instance subscribes to 3 VideoAnalytics services. If Visualizer is added in the ``subscriber_list`` of ``builder_config.json``\ , a single Visualizer instance subscribing to 3 multiple VideoAnalytics is spawned.


Add OEI services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides information about adding a new service, subscribing to the `VideoAnalytics <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-analytics>`_\ , and publishing it on a new port.
Add a service to the OEI stack as a new directory in the `IEdgeInsights <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_ directory. The Builder registers and runs any service present in its own directory in the `IEdgeInsights <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_ directory. The directory should contain the following:


* A ``docker-compose.yml`` file to deploy the service as a docker container. The ``AppName`` is present in the ``environment`` section in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file. Before adding the ``AppName`` to the main ``build/eii_config.json``\ , it is appended to the ``config`` and ``interfaces`` as ``/AppName/config`` and ``/AppName/interfaces``.
* A ``config.json`` file that contains the required config for the service to run after it is deployed. The ``config.json`` consists of the following:

  * A ``config`` section, which includes the configuration-related parameters that are required to run the application.
  * An ``interfaces`` section, which includes the configuration of how the service interacts with other services of the OEI stack.

.. note:: 
   For more information on adding new OEI services, refer to the OEI sample apps at `Samples <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-samples/blob/master/README.md>`_ written in C++, python, and Golang using the OEI core libraries.
   The following example shows how to write the **config.json** for any new service, subscribe to **VideoAnalytics**\ , and publish on a new port:


.. code-block:: javascript

       {
           "config": {
               "paramOne": "Value",
               "paramTwo": [1, 2, 3],
               "paramThree": 4000,
               "paramFour": true
           },
           "interfaces": {
               "Subscribers": [
                   {
                       "Name": "default",
                       "Type": "zmq_tcp",
                       "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65013",
                       "PublisherAppName": "VideoAnalytics",
                       "Topics": [
                           "camera1_stream_results"
                       ]
                   }
               ],
               "Publishers": [
                   {
                       "Name": "default",
                       "Type": "zmq_tcp",
                       "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65113",
                       "Topics": [
                           "publish_stream"
                       ],
                       "AllowedClients": [
                           "ClientOne",
                           "ClientTwo",
                           "ClientThree"
                       ]
                   }
               ]
           }
       }

The ``config.json`` file consists of the following key and values:


* value of the ``config`` key is the config required by the service to run.
* value of the ``interfaces`` key is the config required by the service to interact with other services of OEI stack over the Message Bus.
* the ``Subscribers`` value in the ``interfaces`` section denotes that this service should act as a subscriber to the stream being published by the value specified by ``PublisherAppName`` on the endpoint mentioned in value specified by ``EndPoint`` on topics specified in value of ``Topic`` key.
* the ``Publishers`` value in the ``interfaces`` section denotes that this service publishes a stream of data after obtaining and processing it from ``VideoAnalytics``. The stream is published on the endpoint mentioned in value of ``EndPoint`` key on topics mentioned in the value of ``Topics`` key.
* the services mentioned in the value of ``AllowedClients`` are the only clients that can subscribe to the published stream, if it is published securely over the Message Bus.

.. note:: 


   * Like the interface keys, OEI services can also have "Servers" and "Clients" interface keys. For more information, refer `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/config.json>`_ of the ``VideoIngestion`` service and `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/SWTriggerUtility/config.json>`_ of SWTriggerUtility tool.
   * For more information on the ``interfaces`` key responsible for the Message Bus endpoint configuration, refer `common/libs/ConfigMgr/README.md#interfaces <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-configmgr/blob/master/README.md#interfaces>`_.
   * For the etcd secrets configuration, in the new OEI service or app ``docker-compose.yml`` file, add the following volume mounts with the right ``AppName`` env value:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ...
       volumes:
         - ./Certificates/[AppName]:/run/secrets/[AppName]:ro
         - ./Certificates/rootca/cacert.pem:/run/secrets/rootca/cacert.pem:ro


Distribute the OEI container images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OEI services are available as pre-built container images in the Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/u/openedgeinsights. To access the services that are not available in the Docker Hub, build from source before running the ``docker-compose up -d`` command.
For example:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Update the DOCKER_REGISTRY value in [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env as DOCKER_RESISTRY=<docker_registry> (Make sure `docker login <docker_registry>` to the docker reigstry works)
   cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
   # Base images that needs to be built
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_eiibase
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_common
   # Assuming here that the `python3 builder.py` step has been executed and ia_kapacitor
   # Service exists in the generated compose files
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_kapacitor
   docker-compose up -d
   # Push all the applicable OEI images to <docker_registry>. Ensure to use the same DOCKER_REGISTRY value on the deployment machine while deployment
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-push.yml push

Task 4: Build and run the OEI video and time series use cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: 


   * For running the OEI services in the IPC mode, ensure that the same user is mentioned in the publisher and subscriber services.
   * If the publisher service is running as root such as ``VI``\ , ``VA``\ , then the subscriber service should also run as root. For example, in the ``docker-compose.yml``\ file, if you have specified ``user: ${EII_UID}`` in the publisher service, then specify the same ``user: ${EII_UID}`` in the subscriber service. If you have not specified a user in the publisher service then don't specify the user in the subscriber service.
   * If services needs to be running in multiple nodes in the TCP mode of communication, msgbus subscribers, and clients of ``AppName`` are required to configure the "EndPoint" in ``config.json`` with the ``HOST_IP`` and the ``PORT`` under ``Subscribers/Publishers`` or ``Clients/Servers`` interfaces section.
   * Ensure that the port is being exposed in the ``docker-compose.yml`` of the respective ``AppName``.
     For example, if the ``"EndPoint": <HOST_IP>:65012`` is configured in the ``config.json`` file, then expose the port ``65012`` in the ``docker-compose.yml`` file of the ``ia_video_ingestion`` service.


.. code-block:: yaml

       ia_video_ingestion:
         ...
         ports:
           - 65012:65012

Run all the following OEI build and commands from the ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/`` directory.
OEI supports the following use cases to run the services mentioned in the ``docker_compose.yml`` file. Refer to Task 2 to generate the docker_compose.yml file based on a specific use case. For more information and configuration, refer to the ``[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/README.md`` file.

Build the OEI stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 


   * This is an optional step if you want to use the OEI pre-built container images and don't want to build from source. For more details, refer: `Distribution of OEI container images <#distribution-of-oii-container-images>`__
   * Base OEI services like ``ia_eiibase``\ , ``ia_video_common``\ , and so on, are needed only at the build time and not at the runtime.
     Run the following command to build all OEI services in the ``build/docker-compose-build.yml`` along with the base OEI services.


.. code-block:: sh

   docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build

If any of the services fails during the build, then run the following command to build the service again:

.. code-block:: sh

   docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build --no-cache <service name>

Run OEI services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   Ensure to run ``docker-compose down`` from  `build <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build>`_ directory prior to bringing up OEI stack
   in order to remove running containers and avoid sync issues where other services have come up before ``ia_configmgr_agent``
   container has completed the provisioning step
   If the images tagged with the ``EII_VERSION`` label, as in the `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ do not exist locally in the system but are available in the Docker Hub, then the images will be pulled during the ``docker-compose up``\ command.


OEI Provisioning
""""""""""""""""

The OEI provisioning is taken care by the ``ia_configmgr_agent`` service which gets lauched as part of the OEI stack. For more details on the ConfigMgr Agent component, refer to the `Readme <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-configmgr-agent/blob/master/README.md>`_.

Start OEI in Dev mode
#####################

.. note:: 


   * By default, OEI is provisioned in the secure mode.
   * It is recommended to not use OEI in the Dev mode in a production environment. In the Dev mode, all security features, communication to and from the etcd server over the gRPC protocol, and the communication between the OEI services/apps over the ZMQ protocol are disabled.
   * By default, the OEI empty certificates folder `Certificates <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/Certificates]>`_ will be created in the DEV mode. This happens because of docker bind mounts but it is not an issue.
   * The ``EII_INSTALL_PATH`` in the `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ remains protected both in the DEV and the PROD mode with the Linux group permissions.


Starting OEI in the Dev mode eases the development phase for System Integrators (SI). In the Dev mode, all components communicate over non-encrypted channels. To enable the Dev mode, set the environment variable ``DEV_MODE`` to ``true`` in the ``[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env`` file. The default value of this variable is ``false``.

To provision OEI in the developer mode, complete the following steps:


#. Update ``DEV_MODE=true`` in ``[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env``.
#. Rerun the ``build/builder.py`` to regenerate the consolidated files.

Start OEI in Profiling mode
###########################

The Profiling mode is used for collecting the performance statistics in OEI. In this mode, each OEI component makes a record of the time needed for processing any single frame. These statistics are collected in the visualizer where System Integrtors (SI) can see the end-to-end processing time and the end-to-end average time for individual frames.

To enable the Profiling mode, in the ``[WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env`` file, set the environment variable ``PROFILING`` to ``true``.

Run OEI provisioning service and rest of the OEI stack services
###############################################################

.. note:: 


   * Use the `Etcd UI <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-etcd-ui/blob/master/README.md>`_ to make the changes to the service configs post starting the OEI services.
   * As seen in the `build/eii_start.sh <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/eii_start.sh>`_\ , OEI provisioning and deployment happens in a 2 step process where you need to wait for the initialization of the provisioning container (\ ``ia_configmgr_agent``\ ) before bringing up the rest of the stack. Don't use commands like ``docker-compose restart`` as it will randomly restart all the services leading to issues. To restart any service, use command like ``docker-compose restart [container_name]`` or ``docker restart [container_name]``.


.. code-block:: sh

   # The optional TIMEOUT argument passed below is in seconds and if not provided it will wait
   # till the "Provisioning is Done" message show up in `ia_configmgr_agent` logs before
   # bringing up rest of the OEI stack
   cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
   ./eii_start.sh [TIMEOUT]

.. code-block:: sh

   # To start the native visualizer service, run this command once in the terminal
   xhost +

On successful run, the Visualizer UI is displays the results of video analytics for all video use cases.

Push the required OEI images to docker registry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: 
   By default, if ``DOCKER_REGISTRY`` is empty in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ then the images are published to hub.docker.com. Ensure to remove ``openedgeinsights/`` org from the image names while pushing to Docker Hub, as the repository or image names with multiple slashes are not supported. This limitation doesn't exist in other docker registries like the Azure Container Registry (ACR), Harbor registry, and so on.


Run the following command to push all the OEI service docker images in the ``build/docker-compose-push.yml``. Ensure to update the ``DOCKER_REGISTRY`` value in the `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ file.

.. code-block:: sh

   docker-compose -f docker-compose-push.yml push
