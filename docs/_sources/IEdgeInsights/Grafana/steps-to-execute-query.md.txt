## Steps to execute query
1. Once landed on the Point_Data_Dashboard, green spikes visible in the graph are the results of the default query

2. In the "FROM" section of query, by default it will have 'default point_classifier_results WHERE +',
   click on 'default_classifier_results', drop down will open with the name of Measurements present in InfluxDB.
   If any other measurement is set the graph will switch to the measurement query results.

3. In the "SELECT" section, by default it will have 'field(temperature) mean() +'. Click on 'temperature', a drop down will
   open with the fields tags present in the schema of the measurements set in the FROM section.
   Select any options the graph will react accordingly.
