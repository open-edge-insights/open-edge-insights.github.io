Run the samples apps
--------------------

For default scenario, the sample custom UDF containers are not the mandatory containers to run. The ``builder.py`` script runs the ``sample-apps.yml`` from the `build/usecases <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/usecases>`_ directory and adds all the sample apps containers. Refer to the following list to view the details of the sample apps containers:

.. code-block:: yml

       AppContexts:
       # CPP sample apps for Ubuntu and Alpine operating systems or docker images
       - Samples/publisher/cpp/ubuntu
       - Samples/publisher/cpp/alpine
       - Samples/subscriber/cpp/ubuntu
       - Samples/subscriber/cpp/alpine

       # Python sample apps for Ubuntu operating systems or docker images
       - Samples/publisher/python/ubuntu
       - Samples/subscriber/python/ubuntu

       # Go sample apps for Ubuntu and Alpine operating systems or docker images
       - Samples/publisher/go/ubuntu
       - Samples/publisher/go/alpine
       - Samples/subscriber/go/ubuntu
       - Samples/subscriber/go/alpine


#. 
   To run the ``sample-apps.yml`` file, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

       cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
       python3 builder.py -f ./usecases/sample-apps.yml file used>
