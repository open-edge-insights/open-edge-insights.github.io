High-level logical flow for sample subscriber apps
--------------------------------------------------

The high-level logical flow of a sample subscriber app is as below:


#. 
   Sample apps use the `ConfigMgr <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/common/libs/ConfigMgr/src/cfgmgr.c>`_ APIs to construct the ``msgbus`` config from the ETCD. It fetches its private and public key and the publisher's public key. It then creates the subscriber object (which subscribes to the same topic : publish_test) and start receiving the data and prints the same onto a console.

#. 
   Client contacts the ETCD service and fetches its private key and the server's public key. Then it creates a client object and sends a request to the server and receives the response back.
