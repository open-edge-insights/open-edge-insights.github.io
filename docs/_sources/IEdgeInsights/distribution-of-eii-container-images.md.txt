# Distribution of EII container images

EII services are available as pre-built container images in docker hub at https://hub.docker.com/orgs/openedgeinsights/repositories
and for the ones not listed there, one needs to do the build from source before running `docker-compose up -d` command.

Eg:
```sh
$ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
$ # Base images that needs to be built
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml ia_eiibase
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml ia_common
$ # Assuming here that the `python3 builder.py` step is been executed and ia_kapacitor
$ # service exists in the generated compose files and also, provisioning step is done
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml ia_kapacitor
$ docker-compose up -d
```
