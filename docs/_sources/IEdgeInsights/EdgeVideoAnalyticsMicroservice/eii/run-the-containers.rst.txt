Run the Containers
------------------

To pull the prebuilt Open EII container images and EVAM from Docker Hub and run the containers in the detached mode, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Start the docker containers
   docker-compose up -d

.. note:: 

   The prebuilt container image for the `Edge Video Analytics Microservice <https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/edge_video_analytics_microservice>`_
   gets downloaded when you run the ``docker-compose up -d`` command, if the image is not already present on the host system.
