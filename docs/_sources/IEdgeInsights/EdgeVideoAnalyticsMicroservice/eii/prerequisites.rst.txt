Prerequisites
-------------

As a prerequisite for EVAM, complete the following steps:


#. 
   Run the following commands to get the Open EII source code:

   .. code-block:: sh

       repo init -u "https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests.git"
       repo sync

   ..

      **Note:** For more details, refer `here <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests>`_.


#. 
   Complete the prerequisite for provisioning the Open EII stack by referring to the
   `README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md#provision>`_.

#. Download the required model files to be used for the pipeline mentioned in the `README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/README.md#running-the-image>`_ file by completing step 2 to step 4 as mentioned in the `README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/README.md#running-the-image>`_.
   ..

      **Note:** The model files are large and hence they are not part of the repo.


#. 
   Run the following commands to set the environment, build the ``ia_configmgr_agent`` container and copy models to the required directory:

   .. code-block:: sh

      cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build

      # Execute the builder.py script
      python3 builder.py -f usecases/evas.yml

      # Create some necessary items for the service
      sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel/eii/models/

      # Copy the downloaded model files to /opt/intel/eii
      sudo cp -r [downloaded_model_directory]/models /opt/intel/eii/
