# Troubleshooting

The troubleshooting guide here talks about the useful tips to address some of the EII configuration and installation issues.

2. [eii_libs_installer.sh script failing during bare-metal execution](#2-eii_libs_installersh-script-failing-during-bare-metal-execution)

## 1. "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings during docker-compose up

- Problem Description:

  Issue in starting InfluxDBConnector, Kapacitor and Grafana Services like InfluxDBConnector, Kapacitor, Grafana whose ports
  are exposed to start the service might fail to start during "docker-compose up".

- Error description:

        ERROR: for ia_kapacitor  "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings 

        ERROR: for ia_grafana  "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings 

        ERROR: for ia_influxdbconnector "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings 

        docker.errors.InvalidArgument: "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings

- Possible Cause:

        docker-compose might have been installed using "pip" where version mismatch might be causing the issue.


- Solution:

  Installation of docker-compose using "curl" as mentiond in [Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md](./Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md) will solve the
  issue. Also, following the below command should solve the issue.

  ```sh
  $ sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  $ pip3 uninstall docker-compose
  $ sudo curl L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-`uname -s``uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
  ```

## 2. eii_libs_installer.sh script failing during bare-metal execution

- Problem Description:

  One might run into issue of $GOPATH not being set appropriately which could result in the EII librarires installation failure when run on bare-metal

- Error description:

        CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:63 (message):
        – $GOPATH envronmental variable is not set

        – Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!

        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        compilation terminated.
        error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1

- Possible Cause:

        If "GO" is already installed in the system, eii_libs_installer script skips the installation of it.

        In this case where GO is already installed, GOPATH needs to be set in the system. If not, then above error occurs.

- Solution:

  Installing GO through eii_libs_installer script will install GO and set the required env variables like GOPATH. If not, then one need to set GOPATH
  environment variable with appropriate path.

  ```sh
  $ export GOPATH=<path_to_where_GO_is_installed>
  ```
