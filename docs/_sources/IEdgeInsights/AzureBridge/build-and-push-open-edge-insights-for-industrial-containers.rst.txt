Build and Push Open Edge Insights for Industrial Containers
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. note::  By following the steps below, the Azure Bridge and Simple
   Subscriber Azure IoT Modules will be pushed to your ACR instance as well.


After setting up your development system, build and push the Open EII containers
to your Azure Contianer Registry instance. Note that the Azure Bridge only
supports a few of the Open EII services currently. Before building and pushing your
Open EII containers, be sure to look at the `Supported Open Edge Insights for Industrial Services <#supported-open-edge-insights-for-industrial-services>`__ section below, so as to not build/push uneeded containers to your registry.

To do this go to the ``../build/`` directory in the Open EII source code, modify the ``DOCKER_REGISTRY`` variable in the ``../build/.env`` file to point to your Azure Container Registry.

Next, execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming-azure.yml
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build
   docker-compose -f docker-compose-push.yml push

For more detailed instructions on this process, see the Open EII README and User Guide.
