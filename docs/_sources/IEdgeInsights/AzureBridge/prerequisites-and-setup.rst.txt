Prerequisites and Setup
-----------------------

To use and develop with the Azure Bridge there are a few steps which must be taken to configure your environment. The setup must be done to configure your Azure Cloud account, your development system, and also the node which you are going to deploy the Azure Bridge on.

The following sections cover the setup for the first two environments listed.
Setting up your system for a single-node deployment will be covered in the
`Single-Node Azure IoT Edge Deployment <#single-node-azure-iot-edge-deployment>`__ section below.

.. note::  When you deploy with Azure IoT Hub you will also need to configure
   the Azure IoT Edge Runtime and Open EII on your target device.


Azure Cloud Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to using the Azure Bridge there are a few cloud services in Azure
which must be initialized.

Primarily, you need an Azure Containter Registry instance, an Azure IoT Hub,
as well as an Azure IoT Device. Additionally, if you wish to use the sample ONNX
UDF in Open EII to download a ML/DL model from AzureML, then you must follow a few
steps to get this configured as well. For these steps, see the `Setting up AzureML <#setting-up-azureml>`__
section below.

To create these instances, follow the guides provided by Microsoft below:

.. note::  In the quickstart guides below it is recommended that you create an
   Azure Resource Group. This is a good practice as it makes for easy clean up
   of your Azure cloud environment.



* `Create Azure Container Registry <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-portal>`_
* `Create Azure IoT Hub <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal>`_
* `Register an Azure IoT Device <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-register-device>`_

..

   **IMPORTANT:**
   In the tutorials above you will receive credentials/connection strings for your
   Azure Container Registry, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure IoT Device. Save these for
   later, as they will be important for setting up your development and single node
   deployment showcased in this README.


All of the tutorials provided above provide options for creating these instances
via Visual Studio Code, the Azure Portal, or the Azure CLI. If you wish to use
the Azure CLI, it is recommended that you follow the Development System Setup
instructions below.

Setting up AzureML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the sample Open EII ONNX UDF, you must do the following:


#. Create an AzureML Workspace (see `these <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-workspace>`_
    instructions provided by Microsoft)
#. Configure Service Principle Authentication on your AzureML workspace by following
    instructions provided `here <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-setup-authentication#set-up-service-principal-authentication>`_

Important
~~~~~~~~~

During the setup process provided for step 2 above, you will run a command similar
to the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --name ml-auth

After executing this command you will see a JSON blob printed to your console
window. Save the ``clientId``\ , ``clientSecret``\ , ``subscriptionId``\ , and ``tenantId``
for configuring the sample ONNX Open EII UDF later.

Pushing a Model to AzureML
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you already have an ONNX model you wish to push to your AzureML Workspace, then
follow `these instructions <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-deploy-existing-model>`_
to push your model.

If you do not have a model, and want an easy model to use, follow
`this <https://notebooks.azure.com/azureml/projects/azureml-getting-started/html/how-to-use-azureml/deployment/onnx/onnx-modelzoo-aml-deploy-resnet50.ipynb>`_
notebook provided my Microsoft to train a simple model to push to your AzureML Workspace.

Also, you can find pre-trained models in the `ONNX Model Zoo <https://github.com/onnx/models>`_.

Development System Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The development system will be used for the following actions:


* Building and pushing the Open EII containers (including the bridge) to your Azure Container Registry
* Creating your Azure IoT Hub deployment manifest
* Deploying your manifest to a single node

For testing purposes, your development system can serve to do the actions detailed
above, as well as being the device you use for your single-node deployment. This
should not be done in a production environment, but it can be helpful when
familiarizing yourself with the Azure Bridge.

First, setup your system for building Open EII. To do this, follow the instructions
detailed in the main Open EII README and the Open EII User Guide. At the end, you should
have installed Docker, Docker Compose, and other Open EII Python dependencies for
the Builder script in the ``../build/`` directory.

Once this is completed, install the required components to user the Azure CLI
and development tools. The script ``./tools/install-dev-tools.sh`` automates this
process. To run this script, execute the following command:

.. note:: 


   * It is highly recommended that you use a python virtual environment to install the python packages, so that the system python installation doesn't get altered. Details on setting up and using python virtual environment can be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/
   * If one encounter issues with conflicting dependencies between python packages, please upgrade the pip version: ``pip3 install -U pip`` and try.


.. code-block:: sh

   sudo -H -E -u ${USER} ./tools/install-dev-tools.sh

Please set the ``PATH`` environmental variable as below in the terminal
where you are using ``iotedgedev`` and ``iotedgehubdev`` commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH

.. note:: 


   * 
     The ``-u ${USER}`` flag above allows the Azure CLI to launch your browser (if it can) so you can login to your Azure account.

   * 
     Occasionally, pip's local cache can get corrupted. If this happens,
     pip may ``SEGFAULT``. In the case that this happens, delete the ``~/.local`` directory
     on your system and re-run the script mentioned above. You may consider creating
     a backup of this directory just in case.


While running this script you will be prompted to sign-in to your Azure
account so you can run commands from the Azure CLI that interact with your
Azure instance.

This script will install the following tools:


* Azure CLI
* Azure CLI IoT Edge/Hub Extensions
* Azure ``iotedgehubdev`` development tool
* Azure ``iotedgedev`` development tool

Next, login to your Azure Container Registry with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   az acr login --name <ACR Name>

.. note::  Fill in ``<ACR Name>`` with the name of your Azure Container Registry


**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

Please see the list of supported services at the end of this README for the
services which can be pushed to an ACR instance. Not all Open EII services are
supported by and validated to work with the Azure Bridge.
