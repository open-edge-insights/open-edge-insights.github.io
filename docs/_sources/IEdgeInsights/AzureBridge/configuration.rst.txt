Configuration
-------------

The configuration of the Azure Bridge is a mix of the configuration for the
EII services, the Azure Bridge module, and configuration for the other
Azure IoT Edge Modules (i.e. the Simple Subscriber, and the Azure Blob Storage
modules). All of this configuration is wrapped up into your deployment manifest
for Azure IoT Hub.

The following sections cover the configuration of the aforementioned servies
and then the generation of your Azure Deployment manifest.

Azure Bridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Azure Bridge spans EII and Azure IoT Edge Runtime environments, as such
its configuration is a mix of EII configuration and Azure IoT Edge module configuration
properties. The configuration of the bridge is split between environmental
variables specified in your Azure IoT Hub deployment manifest and the module's
digital twin. Additionally, the digital twin for the Azure Bridge module
contains the entire configuration for the EII services running in your edge
environment.

The configuration of the EII Message Bus is done in a method similar to that of
the other EII services, such as the Video Analytics service. To provided the
configuration for the topics which the bridge should subscribe to,
you must set the ``Subscribers`` list in the `modules/AzureBridge/config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-azure-bridge/blob/master/modules//config.json>`_
file. The list is comprised of JSON objects for every subscription you wish the
Azure Bridge to establish. Below is an example of the configuration for
subscribing to the the publications coming from the Video Analytics container.

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "Subscribers": [
           {
               // Specifies that this is the default subscriber
               "Name": "default",

               // Gives the type of connection, i.e. zmq_tcp, this could
               // also be zmq_ipc
               "Type": "zmq_tcp",

               // The EndPoint specifies the details of the connect, for an
               // IPC connection, this would be a JSON object with the
               // SocketDir key pointing to the directory of the IPC sockets
               "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65013",

               // Specification of the AppName of the service publishing the
               // messages. This allows the Azure Bridge to get the needed
               // authentication keys to subscribe
               "PublisherAppName": "VideoAnalytics",

               // Specifies the list of all of the topics which the
               // AzureBridge shall subscribe to
               "Topics": [
                   "camera1_stream_results"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }

There are a few important implications to be aware of for both ZeroMQ TCP and IPC
subscribers over the EII Message Bus. These implications are specified below.

**ZeroMQ TCP Subscription Implications**

For ZeroMQ TCP subscribers, like the example shown above, the ``EndPoint`` in
the subscriber's configuration object has to be overridden through an
environmental variable. The reason for this, is that the Azure Bridge
service runs attached to a bridged Docker network created by the Azure IoT
Edge Runtime, whereas the other EII services run on the different bridged network.
In order to subscribe, the Azure Bridge must use the host's IP address to
connect.

If the Azure Bridge is only subscribing to a single service, then the
``EndPoint`` can be overridden by setting the ``SUBSCRIBER_ENDPOINT`` environmental
variable. The environmental variable changes if there are multiple subscribers.
For instance, if the configuration example had another object in the Subscribers
list which had the ``Name`` key set to ``example_name``\ , then the environmental
variable name would need to be ``SUBSCRIBER_example_name_ENDPOINT``. Essentially,
for multiple subscribers the ``Name`` property must be in the environmental
variable name between the ``SUBSCRIBER_`` and ``_ENDPOINT``. The same holds true for
``CLIENT_ENDPOINT`` and ``CLIENT_<Name>_ENDPOINT`` usage of environmental variables too.

In either case, the value of the environmental variable must be set to
``$HOST_IP:<PORT>`` where you must fill in what the desired port is. Note that the
IP address is the variable ``$HOST_IP``. This will be pulled from the ``.env`` file
when generating your deployment manifest.

The final implication is on the configuration of the services which the
Azure Bridge is subscribing to. Most EII services publishing over TCP set
their host to ``127.0.0.1``. This keeps the communication only available to
subscribers which are on the local host network on the system. In order for
the Azure Bridge to subscribe to these publications this must be changed
to ``0.0.0.0``.

This can be accomplished by overridding the service's publisher ``EndPoint``
configuration via environmental variables, just like with the Azure Bridge
service. For each service which the Azure Bridge needs to subscribe to over
TCP, add the environmental variable ``PUBLISHER_ENDPOINT=0.0.0.0:<PORT>`` to the
environmental variable configuration of the serivce's module configuration in
your deployment manifest (note: be sure to replace the port).  Or if there are
multiple topics being published, use the variable ``PUBLISHER_<Name>_ENDPOINT``.
The same holds true for ``SERVER_ENDPOINT`` and ``SERVER_<Name>_ENDPOINT`` usage
of environmental variables too.

These variables have already been set for to have the Azure Bridge subscribe
to a single instance of the Video Analytics service. This configuration can be
seen in your deployment manifest under the, "AzureBridge", and, "ia_video_analytics",
modules. Or, you can see this configuration being set in the,
"config/templates/ia_video_analytics.template.json", and,
"config/templates/AzureBridge.template.json", files.

**ZeroMQ IPC Subscription Implications**

If AzureBridge is subscribing to publisher over a ZeroMQ IPC socket, ensure that


* 
  AzureBridge app's subscriber interfaces configuration matches to that of the 
  publisher app's publisher interfaces configuration in ``build/provision/config/eii_config.json``
  file.  Below is an example of the AzureBridge interface configuration subscribing to the 
  publications coming from the VideoIngestion container.

  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
       "Subscribers": [
           {
               // Specifies that this is the default subscriber
               "Name": "default",

               // Gives the type of connection, i.e. zmq_tcp/zmq_ipc
               "Type": "zmq_ipc",

               // The EndPoint specifies the details of the connect, for an
               // IPC connection, this would be a JSON object with the
               // SocketDir key pointing to the directory of the IPC sockets
               "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",

               // Specification of the AppName of the service publishing the
               // messages. This allows the Azure Bridge to get the needed
               // authentication keys to subscriber
               "PublisherAppName": "VideoIngestion",

               // Specifies the list of all of the topics which the
               // AzureBridge shall subscribe to
               "Topics": [
                   "camera1_stream"
               ]
           }
        ]
       }

* 
  Please follow ``Step 3 - Configuring Azure IoT Deployment Manifest`` above to generate the manifest
  template file and deployment manifest files. Ensure to remove all the ``PUBLISHER_ENDPOINT``\ , 
  ``PUBLISHER_<Name>_ENDPOINT``\ , ``SUBSCRIBER_ENDPOINT`` and ``SUBSCRIBER_<Name>_ENDPOINT`` environmental 
  variables from the generated deployment manifest template file i.e., `example.template.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-azure-bridge/blob/master/example.template.json>`_ 
  as these ENVs are not applicable for IPC configuration. Additionally, update the 
  `example.template.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-azure-bridge/blob/master/example.template.json>`_ as per the recommendations mentioned in the 
  ``Important Note`` section for IPC configuration. Please re-generate the deployment manifest file (\ ``config/example.amd64.json``\ )
  by running the below command:

  .. code-block:: sh

     $ iotedgedev genconfig -f example.template.json


* Please follow ``Step 4 - Deployment`` above for deployment

Below is an example digital twin for the Azure Bridge:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "log_level": "DEBUG",
       "topics": {
           "camera1_stream_results": {
               "az_output_topic": "camera1_stream_results"
           }
       },
       "eii_config": "{\"/AzureBridge/config\": {}, \"/AzureBridge/interfaces\": {\"Subscribers\": [{\"EndPoint\": \"127.0.0.1:65013\", \"Name\": \"default\", \"PublisherAppName\": \"VideoAnalytics\", \"Topics\": [\"camera1_stream_results\"], \"Type\": \"zmq_tcp\"}]}, \"/EtcdUI/config\": {}, \"/EtcdUI/interfaces\": {}, \"/GlobalEnv/\": {\"C_LOG_LEVEL\": \"DEBUG\", \"ETCD_KEEPER_PORT\": \"7070\", \"GO_LOG_LEVEL\": \"INFO\", \"GO_VERBOSE\": \"0\", \"PY_LOG_LEVEL\": \"DEBUG\"}, \"/VideoAnalytics/config\": {\"encoding\": {\"level\": 95, \"type\": \"jpeg\"}, \"max_jobs\": 20, \"max_workers\": 4, \"queue_size\": 10, \"udfs\": [{\"device\": \"CPU\", \"model_bin\": \"common/udfs/python/pcb/ref/model_2.bin\", \"model_xml\": \"common/udfs/python/pcb/ref/model_2.xml\", \"name\": \"pcb.pcb_classifier\", \"ref_config_roi\": \"common/udfs/python/pcb/ref/roi_2.json\", \"ref_img\": \"common/udfs/python/pcb/ref/ref.png\", \"type\": \"python\"}]}, \"/VideoAnalytics/interfaces\": {\"Publishers\": [{\"AllowedClients\": [\"*\"], \"EndPoint\": \"0.0.0.0:65013\", \"Name\": \"default\", \"Topics\": [\"camera1_stream_results\"], \"Type\": \"zmq_tcp\"}], \"Subscribers\": [{\"EndPoint\": \"/EII/sockets\", \"Name\": \"default\", \"PublisherAppName\": \"VideoIngestion\", \"Topics\": [\"camera1_stream\"], \"Type\": \"zmq_ipc\", \"zmq_recv_hwm\": 50}]}, \"/VideoIngestion/config\": {\"encoding\": {\"level\": 95, \"type\": \"jpeg\"}, \"ingestor\": {\"loop_video\": true, \"pipeline\": \"./test_videos/pcb_d2000.avi\", \"poll_interval\": 0.2, \"queue_size\": 10, \"type\": \"opencv\"}, \"max_jobs\": 20, \"max_workers\": 4, \"sw_trigger\": {\"init_state\": \"running\"}, \"udfs\": [{\"n_left_px\": 1000, \"n_right_px\": 1000, \"n_total_px\": 300000, \"name\": \"pcb.pcb_filter\", \"scale_ratio\": 4, \"training_mode\": \"false\", \"type\": \"python\"}]}, \"/VideoIngestion/interfaces\": {\"Publishers\": [{\"AllowedClients\": [\"VideoAnalytics\", \"Visualizer\", \"WebVisualizer\", \"TLSRemoteAgent\", \"RestDataExport\"], \"EndPoint\": \"/EII/sockets\", \"Name\": \"default\", \"Topics\": [\"camera1_stream\"], \"Type\": \"zmq_ipc\"}], \"Servers\": [{\"AllowedClients\": [\"*\"], \"EndPoint\": \"127.0.0.1:66013\", \"Name\": \"default\", \"Type\": \"zmq_tcp\"}]}}"
   }

..

   See the ``modules/AzureBridge/config_schema.json`` for the full JSON schema
   for the digital twin of the Azure Bridge module.


Each key in the configuration above is described in the table below.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Description
   * - ``log_level``
     - This is the logging level for the Azure Bridge module, must be INFO, DEBUG, WARN, or ERROR
   * - ``topics``
     - Configuration for the topics to map from the EII Message Bus into the Azure IoT Edge Runtime
   * - ``eii_config``
     - Entire serialized configuration for EII; this configuration will be placed in ETCD


You will notice that the ``eii_config`` is a serialized JSON string. This is due
to a limitation with the Azure IoT Edge Runtime. Currently, module digital twins
do not support arrays; however, the EII configuration requires array support. To
workaround this limitation, the EII configuration must be a serialized JSON
string in the digital twin for the Azure Bridge module.

The ``topics`` value is a JSON object, where each key is a topic from the EII Message
Bus which will be re-published onto the Azure IoT Edge Runtime. The value for
the topic key will be an additional JSON object, where there is one required
key, ``az_output_topic``\ , which is the topic on Azure IoT Edge Runtime to use and
then an optional key, ``az_blob_container_name``. This key specifies the Azure Blob
Storage container to store the images from the EII video analytics pipeline in.
If the ``az_blob_container_name`` key is not specified, then the images will
not be saved.

..

   **IMPORTANT NOTE:** "Container" in the Azure Blob Storage context is not
   referencing a Docker container, but rather a storage structure within the
   Azure Blob Storage instance running on your edge device. For more information
   on the data structure of Azure Blob Storage, see
   `this link <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction#blob-storage-resources>`_.


**IMPORTANT NOTE**

The Azure Blob Storage service places strict requirements on the name of the,
"container", under which it stores blobs. This impacts the value given for the
``az_blob_container_name`` configuration key. According to the Azure documentation,
the name must a valid DNS name adhering to the following rules:


* Container names must start or end with a letter or number, and can contain
    only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
* Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a
    letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
* All letters in a container name must be lowercase.
* Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

For more information on the name conventions/restrictions for Azure Blob Storage
container names, see `this <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/Naming-and-Referencing-Containers--Blobs--and-Metadata>`_
page of the Azure documentation.

Sample EII ONNX UDF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

EII provides a sample UDF which utilizes the ONNX RT to execute your machine learning /
deep learning model. It also supports connecting to an AzureML Workspace to download
the model and then run it. The source code for this UDF is in 
``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/python/sample_onnx/``\ , please also refer 
``Sample ONNX UDF`` section in ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/video/udfs/README.md`` for doing
the required configuration for running this UDF.

To use this UDF with EII, you need to modify your ``build/provision/config/eii_config.json``
configuration file to run the UDF in either your Video Ingesiton or Video Analytics
instance. Then, you need to modify the environmental variables in the ``AzureBridge/.env``
file to provide the connection information to enable the UDF to download your
model from AzureML. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the
`Setting up AzureML <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#setting-up-azureml>`_ section above to configure your
workspace correctly so that the UDF can download your model.

The sample ONNX UDF requires that the following configuration values be set for
the UDF in your ``eii_config.json`` file:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Key
     - Value
   * - ``aml_ws``
     - AzureML workspace name
   * - ``aml_subscription_id``
     - ``subscriptionId`` saved from creating the Service Principal Authentication
   * - ``model_name``
     - Name of the model in your AzureML workspace
   * - ``download_mode``
     - Whether or not to attempt to download the model


.. note::  If ``download_mode`` is ``false``\ , then it expects the ``model_name`` to
   where the ``*.onnx`` model file is in the container.


This should be added into the ``udfs`` list for your Video Ingestion or Video Analytics
instance you wish to have run the UDF. The configuration should look similar to
the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       // ... omited rest of EII configuration ...

       "udfs": [
           {
               "name": "sample_onnx.onnx_udf",
               "type": "python",
               "aml_ws": "example-azureml-workspace",
               "aml_subscription_id": "subscription-id",
               "model_name": "example-model-name",
               "download_model": true
           }
       ]

       // ... omited rest of EII configuration ...
   }

The following environmental variables must be set in the ``AzureBridge/.env`` file
in order to have the sample ONNX UDF download your model from an AzureML Workspace:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``AML_TENANT_ID``
     - The ``tenantId`` saved in the Azure Cloud setup
   * - ``AML_PRINCIPAL_ID``
     - The ``clientId`` saved in the Azure Cloud setup
   * - ``AML_PRINCIPAL_PASS``
     - The ``clientSecret`` saved in the Azure Cloud setup


It is important to note that for the ``AML_PRINCIPAL_PASS`` variable you must wrap the password
in single quotes, i.e. ``'``. Otherwise, there may be characters that get escaped in
a weird way when the values are populated into your deployment manifest leading
to configuration errors.

The ``tenantId``\ , ``clientId``\ , ``clientSecret``\ , and ``subscriptionId`` should all have
been obtained when following the instructions in the `Setting up AzureML <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#setting-up-azureml>`_
section.

Please run the below steps when the ``sample_onnx`` UDF is failing with error like
``The provided client secret keys are expired. Visit the Azure Portal to create new keys for your app``\ :

.. code-block:: sh

   $ az login
   $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth --name ml-auth

The output of above command will be in json format. Please update the ``AML_`` env variables in ``AzureBridge/.env``
as per above table and follow the steps `Step 3 <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#step-3---configuring-azure-iot-deployment-manifest>`_ and
`Step 4 <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#step-4---deployment>`_ to see the ``sample_onnx`` UDF working fine.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

If your system is behind a proxy, you may run into an issue where the download of
your ONNX model from AzureML times out. This may happen even if the proxy is set
globally for Docker on your system. To fix this, update your deployment manifest
template so that the Video Ingestion and/or Video Analytics containers have
the ``http_proxy`` and ``https_proxy`` values set. The manifest should look something
like the following:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       // ... omitted ...

       "modules": {
           "ia_video_ingestion": {
               // ... omitted ...

               "settings": {
                   "createOptions": {
                       "Env": [
                           // ... omitted ...

                           "http_proxy=<YOUR PROXY>",
                           "https_proxy=<YOUR PROXY>",

                           // ... omitted ...
                       ]
                   }
               }

               // ... omitted ...
           }
       }

       // ... omitted ...
   }

Simple Subscriber
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Simple Subscriber module provided with the Azure Bridge is a very simple
service which only receives messages over the Azure IoT Edge Runtime and prints
them to stdout. As such, there is no digital twin required for this module. The
only configuration required is that a route be established in the Azure IoT Edge
Runtime from the Azure Bridge module to the Simple Subscriber module. This
routewill look something like the following in your deployment manifest:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "$schema-template": "2.0.0",
       "modulesContent": {
           // ... omitted for brevity ...

           "$edgeHub": {
               "properties.desired": {
                   "schemaVersion": "1.0",
                   "routes": {
                       "BridgeToSimpleSubscriber": "FROM /messages/modules/AzureBridge/outputs/camera1_stream INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/SimpleSubscriber/inputs/input1\")"
                   },
                   "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
                       "timeToLiveSecs": 7200
                   }
               }
           }

           // ... omitted for brevity ...
       }
   }

For more information on establishing routes in the Azure IoT Edge Runtime,
see `this documentation <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/module-composition#declare-routes>`_.

EII ETCD Pre-Load
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration for EII is given to the Azure Bridge via the ``eii_config``
key in the module's digital twin. As specified in the Azure Bridge configuration
section, this must be a serialized string. For the scripts included with the
Azure Bridge for generating your deployment manifest the ETCD pre-load
configuration is stored at ``config/eii_config.json``. See the EII documentation
for more information on populating this file with your desired EII configuration.
The helper scripts will automatically serialize this JSON file and add it to your
deployment manifest.

Azure Blob Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Azure Bridge enables to use of the Azure Blob Storage edge IoT service
from Microsoft. This service can be used to save images from EII into the blob
storage.

If you wish to have the Azure Blob Storage service save the images to your
host filesystem, then you must do the following:


#. 
   Create the directory to save the data on your host filesystem, it is recommended
    to use the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

       $ sudo mkdir /opt/intel/eii/data/azure-blob-storage
       $ sudo chown eiiuser:eiiuser /opt/intel/eii/data/azure-blob-storage

#. 
   Next, modify your deployment manifest to alter the bind location which the
    Azure Blob Storage service uses. To do this, open your ``*.template.json`` file.
    Provided you specified the Azure Blob Storage service, you should see something
    like the following in your deployment manifest template:

   .. code-block:: json

       {
           "AzureBlobStorageonIoTEdge": {
               "type": "docker",
               "status": "running",
               "restartPolicy": "always",
               "version": "1.0",
               "settings": {
                   "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azure-blob-storage",
                   "createOptions": {
                       "User": "${EII_UID}",
                       "Env": [
                           "LOCAL_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=$AZ_BLOB_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME",
                           "LOCAL_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=$AZ_BLOB_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY"
                       ],
                       "HostConfig": {
                           "Binds": [
                               "az-blob-storage-volume:/blobroot"
                           ]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }

    Change the ``Binds`` location to the following:

   .. code-block:: javascript

       {
           "AzureBlobStorageonIoTEdge": {
               // ... omitted ...
               "settings": {
                   "createOptions": {
                       // ... omitted ...
                       "HostConfig": {
                           "Binds": [
                               "/opt/intel/eii/data/azure-blob-storage/:/blobroot"
                           ]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
       }

    Make sure to run the ``iotedgedev geoncfig -f <manifest-template>`` command
    for the changes to be applied to the actual deployment manifest.

    When you run the Azure Bridge where it is configured to save the images into
    an Azure Blob Storage instance, you should see the images by running the
    following command:

   .. code-block:: sh
