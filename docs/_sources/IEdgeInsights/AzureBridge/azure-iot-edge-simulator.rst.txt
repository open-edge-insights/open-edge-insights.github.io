Azure IoT Edge Simulator
------------------------

Microsoft provides a simluator for the Azure IoT Edge Runtime. During the
setup of your development system (covered in the `Development System Setup <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#development-system-setup>`_
section), the simulator is automatically installed on your system.

Additionally, the Azure Bridge provides the ``./tools/run-simulator.sh`` script
to easily use the simulator with the bridge.

To do this, follow steps 1 - 3 in the `Single-Node Azure IoT Edge Deployment <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#single-node-azure-iot-edge-deployment>`_
section above. Then, instead of step 4, run the following command to setup
the simulator:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo env "PATH=$PATH" iotedgehubdev setup -c "<edge-device-connection-string>"

**NOTE:** The ``env "PATH=$PATH"`` above ensures that the ``PATH`` env variable set in 
the regular user context gets exported to ``sudo`` environment.

Next, start the simulator with your deployment manifest template using the
following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ ./tools/run-simulator.sh ./example.template.json

If everything is running smoothly, you should see messages being printed in the
Simple Subscriber service using the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ docker logs -f SimpleSubscriber

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

You *cannot* run both the Azure IoT Edge Runtime and the simulator simultaneously
on the same system. If you are using the same system, first stop the Azure IoT Edge
Runtime daemon with the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ sudo iotedge system stop

Then, run the simulator as specified above.
