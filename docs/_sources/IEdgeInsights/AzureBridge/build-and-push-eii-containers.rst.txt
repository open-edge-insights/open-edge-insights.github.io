Build and Push EII Containers
-----------------------------

.. note::  By following the steps below, the Azure Bridge and Simple
   Subscriber Azure IoT Modules will be pushed to your ACR instance as well.


After setting up your development system, build and push the EII containers
to your Azure Contianer Registry instance. Note that the Azure Bridge only
supports a few of the EII services currently. Before building and pushing your
EII containers, be sure to look at the `Supported EII Services <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/AzureBridge/#supported-eii-services>`_
section below, so as to not build/push uneeded containers to your registry.

To do this go to the ``../build/`` directory in the EII source code, modify the
``DOCKER_REGISTRY`` variable in the ``../build/.env`` file to point to your Azure
Container Registry.

Next, execute the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming-azure.yml
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-push.yml push

For more detailed instructions on this process, see the EII README and User Guide.
