# EII Uninstaller

The uninstaller script automates the removal of all the EII Docker configuration installed on a system. This uninstaller will perform the following tasks:

1. **Stops and removes all EII running and stopped containers**
2. **Removes all EII docker volumes**
3. **Removes all EII docker images \[Optional\]**
4. **Removes all EII install directory**

Run the below command from `[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/` directory.

```sh
$ ./eii_uninstaller.sh -h
Usage: ./eii_uninstaller.sh [-h] [-d]

 This script uninstalls previous EII version.
 Where:
    -h show the help
    -d triggers the deletion of docker images (by default it will not trigger)

 Example:
  1) Deleting only EII Containers and Volumes
    $ ./eii_uninstaller.sh

  2) Deleting EII Containers, Volumes and Images
    $ export EII_VERSION=2.4
    $ ./eii_uninstaller.sh -d
    above example will delete EII containers, volumes and all the docker images having 2.4 version.
