OEI provision and deployment
----------------------------

For deployment of Open Edge Insights (OEI), helm charts are provided for both provision and deployment.

.. note:: \ :


   * In this document, you will find labels of 'Edge Insights for Industrial (EII)' for filenames, paths, code snippets, and so on. Consider the references of EII as OEI. This is due to the product name change of EII as OEI.
   * Same procedure has to be followed for single or multi node.
   * Please login/configure docker registry before running helm. This would be required when not using public docker hub for accessing images.
