----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#. 
   Set the DEV_MODE as "true/false" in  `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/env>`_ depending on dev or prod mode.

#. 
   Run builder to copy templates file to eii-deploy/templates directory and generate consolidated values.yaml file for eii-services:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
      $ python3 builder.py -f usecases/<usecase>.yml

.. note:: \ :
   ``ia_kapacitor`` and ``ia_telegraf`` container images are not distributed via docker hub, so one won't be able to pull these images
   for time-series use case upon using `../usecases/time-series.yml <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/usecases/time-series.yml`>`_ for deployment. For more details,
   refer: [../README.md#distribution-of-eii-container-images]> (../README.md#distribution-of-eii-container-images).
