   Set the DEV_MODE as "true/false" in  `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ depending on dev or prod mode.

#. 
   Run builder to copy templates file to eii-deploy/templates directory and generate consolidated values.yaml file for eii-services:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
      $ python3 builder.py -f usecases/<usecase>.yml

#. 
   Remove the etcd storage directory

   .. code-block:: sh

      $sudo rm -rf /opt/intel/eii/data/*

Do helm install of provision and deploy charts as per previous section.

    During re-deploy(\ ``helm uninstall`` and ``helm install``\ ) of helm chart for eii-provision and eii-deploy wait for all the pervious pods to terminated successfully.
