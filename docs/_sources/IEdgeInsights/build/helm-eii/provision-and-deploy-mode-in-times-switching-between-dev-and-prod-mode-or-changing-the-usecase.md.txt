## Provision and deploy mode in times switching between dev and prod mode OR changing the usecase

1. Set the DEV_MODE as "true/false" in  [.env](../.env) depending on dev or prod mode.

2. Run builder to copy templates file to eii-deploy/templates directory and generate consolidated values.yaml file for eii-services:
  ```sh
  $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
  $ python3 builder.py -f usecases/<usecase>.yml
  ```

> **NOTE**:
> `ia_kapacitor` and `ia_telegraf` container images are not distributed via docker hub, so one won't be able to pull these images
> for time-series use case upon using [../usecases/time-series.yml](../usecases/time-series.yml`) for deployment. For more details,
> refer: [../README.md#distribution-of-eii-container-images]> (../README.md#distribution-of-eii-container-images).

2. Remove the etcd storage directory
  ```sh
  $sudo rm -rf /opt/intel/eii/data/*
  ```

Do helm install of provision and deploy charts as per previous section.

> **Note**:
> Please wait for all the pods terminated successfully, In times of re-deploy helm chart for eii-provision and eii-deploy
