# Step 4 Provisioning the worker node

```
    # Please ensure the following fields are correctly set in the leader node before generating the provisioning bundle:
    ETCD_HOST=<IP address of leader node>
    DOCKER_REGISTRY=<Docker registry details>

    # commands to be executed on leader node:
    $ cd build/deploy
    $ sudo python3 generate_eii_bundle.py -p

    This will generate the 'worker_provisioning.tar.gz'.
    Do a manual copy of this bundle on worker node. And then follow below commands
    on worker node.
```

```
    # commands to be executed on worker node.
    $ tar -xvzf worker_provisioning.tar.gz
    $ cd worker_provisioning/provision/
