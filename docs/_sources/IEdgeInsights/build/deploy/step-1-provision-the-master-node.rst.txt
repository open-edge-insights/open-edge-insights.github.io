Step 1 Provision the Master node
================================

..

   **Pre-requisite**\ :
   Please follow the EII Pre-requisites before Provisioning.
   `EII Pre-requisites <http://localhost:7645/IEdgeInsights/README.html#eii-pre-requisites>`_

   **NOTE**\ :


   * EII services can run on master as well as worker nodes
   * Master node should have the entire repo/source code present
   * Master node is the primary administative node and has following attributes:

     #. Generating required certificates and secrets.
     #. Loading Initial ETCD values.
     #. Generating bundles to provision new nodes.
     #. Generating bundles to deploy EII services on new/worker nodes.


For running EII in multi node, we have to identify one node to run ETCD server (this node is called as ``master`` node). For a master node, ETCD_NAME in `build/.env <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/.env>`_ must be set to ``master``. Rest other nodes are ``Worker`` nodes which doesn't run ETCD server, instead all the worker nodes remotely connect to the ETCD server running on the ``Master`` node only.

Provision the Master node using the below command,

.. code-block::

       ```
       $ cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
       $ sudo ./provision.sh <path_to_eii_docker_compose_file>

       eq. $ sudo ./provision.sh ../docker-compose.yml

       ```
   This creates the ETCD server (Container ia_etcd) on the master edge node.
