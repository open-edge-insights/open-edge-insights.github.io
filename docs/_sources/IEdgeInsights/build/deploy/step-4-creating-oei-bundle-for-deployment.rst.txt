Step 4 Creating OEI bundle for deployment
-----------------------------------------

.. note::  Before proceeding this step, ensure that you have completed steps 1 to 3.


.. code-block:: sh

     # commands to be executed for bundle creation:
     cd build/deploy
     sudo python3 generate_eii_bundle.py -gb

  This will generate the .tar.gz which has all the required artifacts

**Note:**


* Default Values of Bundle Name is "eii_bundle.tar.gz" and the tag name is "eii_bundle"
* Using the ``-t`` options, you can give your custom tag name which will be used as same name for bundle generation.

For more help:

.. code-block::

   $sudo python3 generate_eii_bundle.py


   usage: generate_eii_bundle.py [-h] [-f COMPOSE_FILE_PATH] [-t BUNDLE_TAG_NAME]

   OEI Bundle Generator: This utility helps to generate the bundle to deploy OEI.

   optional arguments:
       -h, --help            show this help message and exit
       -t BUNDLE_TAG_NAME    Tag Name used for Bundle Generation (default:eii_bundle)


Now this bundle can be used to deploy an OEI on the instance. This bundle has all the required artifacts to start the OEI services.
