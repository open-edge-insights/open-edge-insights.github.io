Step 1 Provision the Leader node
================================

..

   **Pre-requisite**\ :
   Please follow the EII Pre-requisites before Provisioning.
   `EII Pre-requisites <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md#eii-pre-requisites>`_

   **NOTE**\ :


   * EII services can run on leader as well as worker nodes
   * Leader node should have the entire repo/source code present
   * Leader node is the primary administative node and has following attributes:

     #. Generating required certificates and secrets.
     #. Loading Initial ETCD values.
     #. Generating bundles to provision new nodes.
     #. Generating bundles to deploy EII services on new/worker nodes.


For running EII in multi node, we have to identify one node to run ETCD server (this node is called as ``leader`` node). For a leader node, ETCD_NAME in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/env>`_ must be set to ``leader``. Rest other nodes are ``Worker`` nodes which doesn't run ETCD server, instead all the worker nodes remotely connect to the ETCD server running on the ``Leader`` node only. Make sure the ``date`` and ``time`` are in sync in all nodes.

Provision the Leader node using the below command:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
   $ sudo -E ./provision.sh <path_to_eii_docker_compose_file>

   $ # eq. $ sudo -E ./provision.sh ../docker-compose.yml

This creates the ETCD server (Container ia_etcd) on the leader edge node.
