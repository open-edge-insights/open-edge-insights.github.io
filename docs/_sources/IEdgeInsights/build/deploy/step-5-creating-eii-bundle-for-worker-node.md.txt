# Step 5 Creating eii bundle for worker node
> **NOTE**: Before proceeding this step, please make sure, you have followed steps 1-4.

```
    # Please ensure the following fields are correctly set in the leader node before generating the eii bundle:
    ETCD_HOST=<IP address of leader node>
    DOCKER_REGISTRY=<Docker registry details>

    # commands to be executed on leader node:
    $ cd build/deploy
    $ sudo python3 generate_eii_bundle.py

    This will generate the .tar.gz which has all the required artifacts by which eii services
    can be started on worker node.
```
***Note***:

    1. Default Values of Bundle Name is "eii_bundle.tar.gz" and the tag name is "eii_bundle"

    2. Using *-t* options you can give your custom tag name which will be used as same name for bundle generation.

    3. Default values for docker-compose yml path is "../docker-compose.yml"

For more help:

    $sudo python3 generate_eii_bundle.py


    usage: generate_eii_bundle.py [-h] [-f COMPOSE_FILE_PATH] [-t BUNDLE_TAG_NAME]

    EII Bundle Generator: This Utility helps to Generate the bundle to deploy EII.

    optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -t BUNDLE_TAG_NAME    Tag Name used for Bundle Generation (default:eii_bundle)


Now this bundle can be used to deploy an eii on worker node. This bundle has all the required artifacts to start the eii
services on worker node.
