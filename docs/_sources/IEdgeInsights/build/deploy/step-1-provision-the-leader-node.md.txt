# Step 1 Provision the Leader node

> **Pre-requisite**:
> Please follow the EII Pre-requisites before Provisioning.
> [EII Pre-requisites](../../README.md#eii-pre-requisites)

> **NOTE**:
> * EII services can run on leader as well as worker nodes
> * Leader node should have the entire repo/source code present
> * Leader node is the primary administative node and has following attributes:
>   1. Generating required certificates and secrets.
>   2. Loading Initial ETCD values.
>   3. Generating bundles to provision new nodes.
>   4. Generating bundles to deploy EII services on new/worker nodes.


For running EII in multi node, we have to identify one node to run ETCD server (this node is called as `leader` node). For a leader node, ETCD_NAME in [build/.env](../.env) must be set to `leader`. Rest other nodes are `Worker` nodes which doesn't run ETCD server, instead all the worker nodes remotely connect to the ETCD server running on the `Leader` node only. Make sure the `date` and `time` are in sync in all nodes.

Provision the Leader node using the below command,

        ```
        $ cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
        $ sudo ./provision.sh <path_to_eii_docker_compose_file>

        eq. $ sudo ./provision.sh ../docker-compose.yml

        ```
    This creates the ETCD server (Container ia_etcd) on the leader edge node.
