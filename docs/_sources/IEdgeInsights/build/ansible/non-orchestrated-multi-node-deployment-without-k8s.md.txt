## Non-orchestrated multi node deployment (without k8s)
 
Below configuration changes need to be made for multi node deployment without k8s

1. Set `multi_node: true` in `group_vars/all.yml` to enable multinode deployment and `false` to enable single node deployment. Update `vars/vars.yml` to the services to run on a specific node in case of multi_node deployment by following [this](#Select-EII-services-to-run-on-a-particular-node-in-multinode-deployment), where in single node deployment all the services based on the `usecase` chosen will be deployed. 
2. Update `docker` registry details in following section if using a custom/private registry
    ``` sh
        docker_registry="<regsitry_url>"
        docker_login_user="<username>"
        docker_login_passwd="<password>"
    ```
    > **Note**: Use of `docker_registry` and `build` flags
    > * Update `docker_registry` details to use docker images from custom registry, optionally set `build: true` to push docker images to this registry
    > * Unset `docker_registry` details if you don't want to use custom registry and set `build: true` to save and load docker images from one node to another node
3. If you are using images from docker hub, then set `build: false` and unset `docker_registry` details
