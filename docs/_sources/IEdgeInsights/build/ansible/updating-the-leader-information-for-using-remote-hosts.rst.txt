Updating the leader information for using remote hosts
------------------------------------------------------

.. note:: 
   By ``default`` both control/leader node ``ansible_connection`` will be ``localhost`` in single node deployment.


Please follow below steps to update the details of leader node for remote node scenario.


* 
  Update the hosts information in the inventory file ``hosts``

  .. code-block:: sh

           [group_name]
           <nodename> ansible_connection=ssh ansible_host=<ipaddress> ansible_user=<machine_user_name>

    For Eg:

  .. code-block:: sh

       [targets]
       leader ansible_connection=ssh ansible_host=192.0.0.1  ansible_user=user1

  ..

     **Note**


     * ``ansible_connection=ssh`` is mandatory when you are updating any remote hosts, which makes ansible to connect via ``ssh``.
     * The above information is used by ansible to establish ssh connection to the nodes.
     * control node will always be ``ansible_connection=local``\ , **don't update the control node's information**
     * To deploy OEI in single , ``ansible_connection=local`` and ``ansible_host=localhost``
     * To deploy OEI on remote node, ``ansible_connection=ssh`` and ``ansible_host=<remote_node_ip>`` and ``ansible_user``\ =\ :raw-html-m2r:`<username>`
