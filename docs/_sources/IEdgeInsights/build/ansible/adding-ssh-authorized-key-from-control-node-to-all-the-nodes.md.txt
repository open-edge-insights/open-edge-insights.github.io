## Adding SSH Authorized Key from control node to all the nodes

Please follow the step shown below  to copy the generated keys from control node to all other nodes

Execute the following command from `control` node.
```sh
    $ ssh-copy-id <USER_NAME>@<HOST_IP>
```

For example.
```sh
    $ ssh-copy-id test@192.0.0.1

    /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

    Number of key(s) added: 1

    Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'test@192.0.0.1'"
    and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

### Configure Sudoers file to accept NO PASSWORD for sudo operation.

> **Note**: Ansible needs to execute some commands as `sudo`. The below configuration is needed so that `passwords` need not be saved in the ansible inventory file `hosts`

Update `sudoers` file

1. Open the `sudoers` file.
    ```sh
        $ sudo visudo
    ```

2. Append the following to the `sudoers` file.
   > **Note**: Please append to the last line of the `sudoers` file.

   ```sh
       $ <ansible_non_root_user>  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```
   For example:

   If in control node, the current non root user is `user1`, you should append as follows
   ```sh
      user1 ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```
3. Save & Close the file.

4. For checking the `sudo` access for the enabled `user`, please logout and login to the session again and 
   check the following command.
   ```sh
      $ sudo -l -U <ansible_non_root_user> 
   ```
   Now the above line authorizes `user1` user to do `sudo` operation in the control node without `PASSWORD` ask.
   > **Note**: The same procedure applies to all other nodes where Ansible connection is involved.
