## Updating the leader & worker node's information for using remote hosts

>**Note**: By `default` both control/leader node `ansible_connection` will be `localhost` in single node deployment.

Please follow below steps to update the details of leader/worker nodes for multi node scenario.

*   Update the hosts information in the inventory file `hosts`
    ```
        [group_name]
        <nodename> ansible_connection=ssh ansible_host=<ipaddress> ansible_user=<machine_user_name>
    ```

    For Eg:
    ```
    [targets]
    leader ansible_connection=ssh ansible_host=192.0.0.1  ansible_user=user1
    ```
    
    > **Note**: 
    > * `ansible_connection=ssh` is mandatory when you are updating any remote hosts, which makes ansible to connect via `ssh`.
    > * The above information is used by ansible to establish ssh connection to the nodes.
    > * control node will always be `ansible_connection=local`, **don't update the control node's information**
    > * To deploy EII in single , `ansible_connection=local` and `ansible_host=localhost`
    > * To deploy EII on multiple nodes, add hosts(worker1, worker2 etc..) details to the inventory file
