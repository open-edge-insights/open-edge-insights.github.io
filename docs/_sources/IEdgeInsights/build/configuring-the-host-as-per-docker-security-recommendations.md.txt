## **Configuring the Host as per Docker security recommendations.**

**1) Ensure a separate partition for containers has been created**
  
• To ensure proper isolation, it's a good idea to keep Docker containers and all of /var/lib/docker on their own filesystem partition.

After installing docker, in order to steps:

Remove all Docker containers and images.

``` 
	docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq); docker rmi -f $(docker images -q) 
```

Stop the Docker service.

``` 
	sudo systemctl stop docker 
```

 Remove the Docker storage directory.

 ``` 
 	rm -rf /var/lib/docker
 ```

Create a new /var/lib/docker storage directory.

``` 
	mkdir /var/lib/docker
```

Use bind mount to set the new location. For example, to set the new location as /mnt/docker run the following commands:

```
	mkdir /mnt/docker
    
	mount --rbind /mnt/docker /var/lib/docker
```
  
Start the Docker service.

``` 
  	sudo systemctl start docker
```

**2) Ensure Docker is up to Date**

Check which version is the current stable release by visiting the Docker CE release notes. If you're not up to date, please upgrade the Docker package.

**3) Ensure auditing is configured for various Docker files**

Install and configure auditd to enable auditing of some of Docker's files, directories, and sockets. Auditd is a Linux access monitoring and accounting subsystem that logs noteworthy system operations at the kernel level. More info https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/7-audit.rules/

Place the following snippet at the bottom of the file “/etc/audit/audit.rules”

```
  	    -w /usr/bin/docker -p wa
	    -w /var/lib/docker -p wa
	    -w /etc/docker -p wa
	    -w /lib/systemd/system/docker.service -p wa
	    -w /lib/systemd/system/docker.socket -p wa
	    -w /etc/default/docker -p wa
	    -w /etc/docker/daemon.json -p wa
	    -w /usr/bin/docker-containerd -p wa
	    -w /usr/bin/docker-runc -p wa
```
