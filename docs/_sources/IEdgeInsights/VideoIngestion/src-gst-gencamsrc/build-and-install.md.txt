## Build and Install
Following is the command to build the plugin.
```
$ ./setup.sh
```
This script does the following
1.	Downloads the GenICam runtime binaries (verision 3.1) from EMVA website
2.	Unzips the binary and except Linux64 for x86_64 tar ball, deletes all other files
3.	Untars Linux64 for x86_64 tar ball and copies to standard library path in Ubuntu, i.e., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
4.	Runs configure command to configure the project generating Makefile
5.	Calls make to build
6.	Installs the generated gencamsrc shared library to /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
7.	Sets the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH to /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

If plugin is installed successsfully, should be able to inspect it. 
```
$ gst-inspect-1.0 gencamsrc
```
If it returns information about the plugin, then it's installed successfully 
and can be used like any other gstreamer source.
