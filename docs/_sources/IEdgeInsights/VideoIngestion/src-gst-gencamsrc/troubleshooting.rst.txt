GenICam runtime binaries error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the pipeline returns error similar below, then GenICam runtime dependency is not resolved.

.. code-block::

   $ module_open failed: libGenApi_gcc42_v3_1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

In that case, download and copy the GenICam runtime binaries to standard path. The copied files are stored in the system after reboot.


#. Download this file - https://www.emva.org/wp-content/uploads/GenICam_V3_1_0_public_data.zip
#. Unzip to get runtime binaries and SDK files for multiple platforms
#. Untar GenICam_Runtime_gcc42_Linux32_i86_v3_1_0.tgz file
#. Under bin/Linux64_x64 directory, there will be shared libraries, copy all of them to usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu path

GenTL producer error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the pipeline returns error similar below, then GenTL producer is not found.

.. code-block::

   $ No transport layers found in path

In that case, set GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH environment variable to the GenTL producer installation path. Please install the compatible GenTL producer for the camera if not already done.

For Basler camera, the GenTL producer can be downloaded from https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/pylon-5-0-12-linux-x86-64-bit-debian/

Upon installation of this software, GenTL will be present in “/opt/pylon5/lib64/gentlproducer/gtl”, accordingly set the environment variable.

.. code-block::

   $ export GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH=/opt/pylon5/lib64/gentlproducer/gtl/

This variable may be set variable in .bashrc file so that it is one-time and need not be set every time when the terminal is opened.
