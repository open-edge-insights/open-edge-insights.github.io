Build and Install
-----------------

Following is the command to build the plugin.

.. code-block::

   $ ./setup.sh

This script does the following


#. Downloads the GenICam runtime binaries (verision 3.1) from EMVA website
#. Unzips the binary and except Linux64 for x86_64 tar ball, deletes all other files
#. Untars Linux64 for x86_64 tar ball and copies to standard library path in Ubuntu, i.e., /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
#. Runs configure command to configure the project generating Makefile
#. Calls make to build
#. Installs the generated gencamsrc shared library to /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0
#. Sets the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH to /usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

If plugin is installed successsfully, should be able to inspect it. 

.. code-block::

   $ gst-inspect-1.0 gencamsrc

If it returns information about the plugin, then it's installed successfully 
and can be used like any other gstreamer source.
