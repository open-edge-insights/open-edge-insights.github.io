## TO RUN THE TOOL IN zmq_ipc MODE

User needs to modify interface section of **[config.json](./config.json)** as following

```
    {
        "type": "zmq_ipc",
        "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets"
    }
```


NOTE: If you want good and bad frames then the query must contain the following parameters:
	
	*img_handle
	*defects
	*encoding_level
	*encoding_type
	*height
	*width
	*channel

    Example: 
     "select img_handle, defects, encoding_level, encoding_type,  height, width, channel from camera1_stream_results order by desc limit 10"

     or

     "select * from camera1_stream_results order by desc limit 10"
