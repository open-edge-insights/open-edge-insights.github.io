# PROCEDURE TO RUN DISCOVERY TOOL (DEFAULT: PROD MODE) #

 1. DiscoverHistory expects a set of config, interfaces & public private keys to be present in ETCD as a pre-requisite.
    To achieve this, please ensure an entry for DiscoverHistory with its relative path from [IEdgeInsights](../../) directory is set in the video-streaming-storage.yml file present in [build/usecases](../../build/usecases) directory. An example has been provided below:
    ```sh
        AppContexts:
        - VideoIngestion
        - VideoAnalytics
        - Visualizer
        - WebVisualizer
        - tools/DiscoverHistory
        - ImageStore
        - InfluxDBConnector
    ```

 2. Open "config.json"
 3. Provide the required query to be passed on to InfluxDB.
 4. With the above pre-requisite done, please run the below to command:
    ```sh
        python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming-storage.yml
    ```
 5. Refer [main EII README.md](../../README.md) to provision, build and run the tool along with the EII video-streaming-storage recipe/stack.
 6. Check imagestore and influxdbconnector services are running.
 7. You will find data & frames directories at "/opt/intel/eii/tools_output".
    (Note: if img_handle is part of select statement , then only frames
    directory will be created)
 8. Use ETCDUI to change the query in configuration. Please run below command to start container with new configuration:
     ```sh
        docker restart ia_discover_history
     ```
 ## ADDITIONAL STEP TO RUN DISCOVERY TOOL IN DEV MODE
 1. Open [.env](../../build/.env)
 2. Set the DEV_MODE variable as "true".
 ```
    DEV_MODE=false
 ```
to
 ```
    DEV_MODE=true
 ```

### NOTE:Building the base images like ia_common, ia_eiibase are must in cases if this tool isn't run on the same node where EII is running.
### Please ensure that the base images i.e. ia_common and ia_eiibase are present on the node where this tool is run.
