## EII Video Profiler modes

    By default the EII Video Profiler supports two modes, which are 'fps' & 'monitor' mode.

1. FPS mode

    Enabled by setting the 'mode' key in [config](./config.json) to 'fps', this mode calculates the frames
    per second of any EII module by subscribing to that module's respective stream.
    ```sh
        "mode": "fps"
    ```

2. Monitor mode

    Enabled by setting the 'mode' key in [config](./config.json) to 'monitor', this mode calculates average & per frame stats
    for every frame while identifying if the frame was blocked at any queue of any module across the video pipeline thereby
    determining the fastest/slowest components in the pipeline.
    To be performant in profiling scenarios, VideoProfiler is enabled to work when subscribing only to a single topic in monitor mode.

    User must ensure that `ingestion_appname` and `analytics_appname` fields of the `monitor_mode_settings` need to be set accordingly for monitor mode.

    Refer the below exmaple config where VideoProfiler is used in monitor mode to subscribe PySafetyGearAnalytics CustomUDF results.

    ```javascript
        "config": {
        "mode": "monitor",
        "monitor_mode_settings": {
                                    "ingestion_appname": "PySafetyGearIngestion",
                                    "analytics_appname": "PySafetyGearAnalytics",
                                    "display_metadata": false,
                                    "per_frame_stats":false,
                                    "avg_stats": true
                                },
        "total_number_of_frames" : 5,
        "export_to_csv" : false
    }
    ```

    ```sh
        "mode": "monitor"
    ```

    The stats to be displayed by the tool in monitor_mode can be set in the monitor_mode_settings key of [config.json](config.json).
    1. 'display_metadata': Displays the raw meta-data with timestamps associated with every frame.
    2. 'per_frame_stats': Continously displays the per frame metrics of every frame.
    3. 'avg_stats': Continously displays the average metrics of every frame.

  > **Note:**
  > * Pre-requisite for running in profiling or monitor mode: VI/VA should be running with PROFILING_MODE set to **true** in [.env](../../build/.env)
  > * For running Video Profiler in FPS mode, it is recommended to keep PROFILING_MODE set to false in [.env](../../build/.env) for better performance.
