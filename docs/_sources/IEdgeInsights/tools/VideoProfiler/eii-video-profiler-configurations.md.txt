## EII Video Profiler configurations

1. dev_mode

    Setting this to false enables secure communication with the EII stack. User must ensure this switch is in sync with DEV_MODE in [.env](../../build/.env)
    With PROD mode enabled, the path for the certs mentioned in [config](./config.json) can be changed by the user to point to the required certs.

2. total_number_of_frames

    If mode is set to 'fps', the average FPS is calculated for the number of frames set by this variable.
    If mode is set to 'monitor', the average stats is calculated for the number of frames set by this variable.
    Setting it to (-1) will run the profiler forever unless terminated by signal interrupts('Ctrl+C').
    total_number_of_frames should never be set as (-1) for 'fps' mode.

3. export_to_csv

    Setting this switch to **true** exports csv files for the results obtained in VideoProfiler. For monitor_mode, runtime stats printed in the csv
    are based on the the following precdence: avg_stats, per_frame_stats, display_metadata.
