# EII Video Profiler

This tool can be used to determine the complete metrics involved in the entire Video pipeline by
measuring the time difference between every component of the pipeline and checking for Queue blockages
at every component thereby determining the fast or slow components of the whole pipeline.
It can also be used to calculate the FPS of any EII modules based on the stream published by that respective
module.
