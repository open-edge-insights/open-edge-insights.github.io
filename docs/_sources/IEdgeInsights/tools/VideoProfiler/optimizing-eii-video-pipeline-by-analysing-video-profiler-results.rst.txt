Optimizing EII Video pipeline by analysing Video Profiler results
-----------------------------------------------------------------


#. 
   VI ingestor/UDF input queue is blocked, consider reducing ingestion rate.

    If this log is displayed by the Video Profiler tool, it indicates that the ingestion rate is too high or the VideoIngestion
    UDFs are slow and causing latency throughout the pipeline.
    As per the log suggests, the user can increase the poll_interval to a optimum value to reduce the blockage of VideoIngestion
    ingestor queue thereby optimizing the video pipeline in case using the opencv ingestor.
    In case Gstreamer ingestor is used, the videorate option can be optimized by following the `README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/README.md>`_.

#. 
   VA subs/UDF input queue is blocked, consider reducing ZMQ_RECV_HWM value or reducing ingestion rate.

    If this log is displayed by the Video Profiler tool, it indicates that the VideoAnalytics UDFs are slow and causing latency
    throughout the pipeline.
    As per the log suggests, the user can consider reducing ZMQ_RECV_HWM to an optimum value to free the VideoAnalytics UDF input/subscriber
    queue by dropping incoming frames or reducing the ingestion rate to a required value.

#. 
   UDF VI output queue blocked.

    If this log is displayed by the Video Profiler tool, it indicates that the VI to VA messagebus transfer is delayed.


   #. User can consider reducing the ingestion rate to a required value.
   #. User can increase ZMQ_RECV_HWM to an optimum value so as to not drop
      the frames when the queue is full or switching to IPC mode of communication.

#. 
   UDF VA output queue blocked.

    If this log is displayed by the Video Profiler tool, it indicates that the VA to VideoProfiler messagebus transfer is delayed.


   #. User can consider reducing the ingestion rate to a required value.
   #. User can increase ZMQ_RECV_HWM to an optimum value so as to not drop
      the frames when the queue is full or switching to IPC mode of communication.
