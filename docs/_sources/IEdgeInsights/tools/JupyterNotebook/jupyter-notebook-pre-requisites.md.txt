## Jupyter Notebook pre-requisites

1. Jupyter Notebook expects a set of config, interfaces & public private keys to be present in ETCD as a pre-requisite.
    * To achieve this, please ensure an entry for Jupyter Notebook with its relative path from [IEdgeInsights](../../) directory is set in any of the .yml files present in [build/usecases](../../build/usecases) directory.
    * An example has been provided below to add the entry in [video-streaming.yml](../../build/usecases/video-streaming.yml)
    ```yml
        AppContexts:
        ---snip---
        - tools/JupyterNotebook
    ```

2. Ensure the [jupyter_connector](../../common/video/udfs/python/jupyter_connector.py) UDF is enabled in the config of either **VideoIngestion** or **VideoAnalytics** to be connected to JupyterNotebook. An example has been provided here for connecting **VideoIngestion** to **JupyterNotebook**, the config to be changed being present at [config.json](../../VideoIngestion/config.json):
    ```javascript
        {
            "config": {
                "encoding": {
                    "type": "jpeg",
                    "level": 95
                },
                "ingestor": {
                    "type": "opencv",
                    "pipeline": "./test_videos/pcb_d2000.avi",
                    "loop_video": true,
                    "queue_size": 10,
                    "poll_interval": 0.2
                },
                "sw_trigger": {
                    "init_state": "running"
                },
                "max_workers":4,
                "udfs": [{
                    "name": "jupyter_connector",
                    "type": "python",
                    "param1": 1,
                    "param2": 2.0,
                    "param3": "str"
                }]
            }
        }
    ```
