Jupyter Notebook usage to develop python UDFs
=============================================

UDF development in python can be done using the web based IDE of Jupyter Notebook.
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

This tool acts as an interface between user and Jupyter Notebook service allowing the user to interact with Jupyter Notebook to write, edit, experiment and create python UDFs.

It works along with the `jupyter_connector <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/tree/master/udfs/python/jupyter_connector.py>`_ UDF for enabling the IDE for udf development.
