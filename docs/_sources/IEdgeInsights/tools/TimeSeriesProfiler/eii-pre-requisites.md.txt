## EII pre-requisites

1. TimeSeriesProfiler expects a set of config, interfaces & public private keys to be present in ETCD as a pre-requisite.
    To achieve this, please ensure an entry for TimeSeriesProfiler with its relative path from [IEdgeInsights](../../) directory is set in the time-series.yml file present in [build/usecases](../../build/usecases) directory. An example has been provided below:
    ```sh
        AppContexts:
        - Grafana
        - InfluxDBConnector
        - Kapacitor
        - Telegraf
        - tools/TimeSeriesProfiler
    ```

2. With the above pre-requisite done, please run the below command:
    ```sh
        python3 builder.py -f ./usecases/time-series.yml
    ```
