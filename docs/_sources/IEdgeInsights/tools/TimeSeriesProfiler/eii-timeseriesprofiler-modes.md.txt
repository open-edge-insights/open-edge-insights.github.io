## EII TimeSeriesProfiler modes

    By default the EII TimeSeriesProfiler supports two modes, which are 'sps' & 'monitor' mode.

1. SPS mode

    Enabled by setting the 'mode' key in [config](./config.json) to 'sps', this mode calculates the samples
    per second of any EII module by subscribing to that module's respective stream.
    ```sh
        "mode": "sps"
    ```

2. Monitor mode

    Enabled by setting the 'mode' key in [config](./config.json) to 'monitor', this mode calculates average & per sample stats

    Refer the below exmaple config where TimeSeriesProfiler is used in monitor mode.

    ```javascript
        "config": {
        "mode": "monitor",
        "monitor_mode_settings": {
                                    "display_metadata": false,
                                    "per_sample_stats":false,
                                    "avg_stats": true
                                },
        "total_number_of_samples" : 5,
        "export_to_csv" : false
    }
    ```

    ```sh
        "mode": "monitor"
    ```

    The stats to be displayed by the tool in monitor_mode can be set in the monitor_mode_settings key of [config.json](config.json).
    1. 'display_metadata': Displays the raw meta-data with timestamps associated with every sample.
    2. 'per_sample_stats': Continously displays the per sample metrics of every sample.
    3. 'avg_stats': Continously displays the average metrics of every sample.

  > **Note:**
  > * Pre-requisite for running in profiling or monitor mode: Time series containers should be running with PROFILING_MODE set to **true** in [.env](../../build/.env)
  > * For running TimeSeriesProfiler in SPS mode, it is recommended to keep PROFILING_MODE set to false in [.env](../../build/.env) for better performance.
