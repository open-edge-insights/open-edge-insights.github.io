## Configuration file:

**config.json** is the configuration file used for sw_trigger_utility.

|       Field      | Meaning |                                       Type of the value                                    |
| :-------------:  | :-----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `num_of_cycles`  | `Number of cyles of start-stop ingestions to repeat`   | `integer`                           |
| `dev_mode`       | `dev mode ON or OFF`   | `boolean (true or false)`  |
| `log_level`      | `Log level to view the logs accordingly`   |  `integer [DEBUG=3 (default), ERROR=0, WARN=1, INFO=2]`  |

> **Note**:

> * When working with GigE cameras which requires `network_mode: host`, update the `EndPoint` key of SWTriggerUtility interface in [config.json](./config.json) to have the host system IP instead of the service name of the server.

    Eg. In order to connect to `ia_video_ingestion` service which is configured with GigE camera refer the below `EndPoint` change in the SWTriggerUtility interface:

    ```javascript
    {
        "Clients": [
            {
                "EndPoint": "<HOST_SYSTEM_IP>:64013",
                "Name": "default",
                "ServerAppName": "VideoIngestion",
                "Type": "zmq_tcp"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

> * In case one needs to change the values in [config.json](./config.json), then ensure to re-run the steps mentioned in [pre-requisites section](#software-trigger-utilily-pre-requisites) to see the updated changes are getting applied `OR` one can choose to update the config key of SWTriggerUtility app via ETCD UI and then restart the application.


**This utility works in both dev & prod mode.**  As a pre-requisite make sure to turn ON the flag corresponding to "dev_mode" to true/false in the config.json file.
