## Running Software Trigger Utility

1. EII services can be running in prod or dev mode by setting `DEV_MODE` value accordingly in [build/.env](../../build/.env)

2. Execute builder.py script:
   ```sh
   $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/
   $ python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming.yml
   ```

   **NOTE**: The same yml file to which the **SWTriggerUtility** entry was added in [pre-requisites](#software-trigger-utilily-pre-requisites) has to be selected while running [builder](../../build/builder.py)

3. Run provisioning step as below:

   ```sh
   $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
   $ sudo -E ./provision.sh  ../docker-compose.yml
   ```
