**Build and deploy Process**
================================

The build process is similar to the EII's build and deploy process with some minor chnages. Please find the ordered steps for building and deploying the Custom UDFs.


* 
  As per EII default scenario, the sample custom UDF containers are not mandatory containers to run, hence the builder.py should run "video-streaming-all-udfs.yml". All the sample UDF containers are added in this example. Below code snnipet signifies the same.

  .. code-block:: yml

     AppName:
     - VideoIngestion
     - VideoAnalytics
     - Visualizer
     - WebVisualizer
     - CustomUdfs/NativeSafetyGearAnalytics   <<<<< All lines from here added are customUDFs, User can define his own container directory here
     - CustomUdfs/NativeSafetyGearIngestion
     - CustomUdfs/PyMultiClassificationIngestion
     - CustomUdfs/PySafetyGearAnalytics
     - CustomUdfs/PySafetyGearIngestion

  Run the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd <multi-repo cloned path>/IEdgeInsights/build/
     python3 builder.py -f video-streaming-all-udfs.yml

  **Note:**
  It is not mandatory to keep the custom Udfs in the CustomUdfs directory, but user must change the video-streaming-all-udfs.yml file accordingly to point the right path accordingly.
  Additionally if it is placed under **\ *IEdgeInsights*\ ** directory then the builder.py file automatically picks it to generate a consolidated `\ **\ *docker-compose.yml*\ ** <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/docker-compose.yml>`_ and `\ **\ *docker-compose.yml*\ ** <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/docker-compose.yml>`_ file.

* 
  After generation of consolidated `\ **\ *docker-compose.yml*\ ** <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/docker-compose.yml>`_ and `\ **\ *docker-compose.yml*\ ** <https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/Indu/edge-insights-industrial/eii-core/-/blob/master/build/docker-compose.yml>`_ file, Run the below command to provision the UDF containers. As a pre-cautionary measure, User can cross check the afore-mentioned file to verify the sanity of the UDF specific config and service details.

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd <WORK_DIR_PATH>/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
     sudo ./provision.sh  ../docker-compose.yml

* Build and run the containers.
  .. code-block:: bash

     docker-compose up --build -d
