**VideoIngestion micro-service exposes the functionality of software trigger in the following ways:**

  1) It can accept software trigger to "START_INGESTION"/ "STOP_INGESTION"/ "SNAPSHOT" from any client utility which uses the EII messagebus over server-client model.

  2) The software trigger functionality of VI is demonstrated using an sample baremetal utility called "SW_Trigger_utility", which is shipped with the VideoIngestion code in tools repo, the details of the usage of this utility is mentioned in `../../tools/SWTriggerUtility/README.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_.

.. note:: \ : When the ``init_state`` value is ``running`` then ingestor is started without any sw trigger from the client. In order to control the ingestor using the sw trigger utility change the value to ``stopped``. To refer the available option to generate the sw trigger refer `../tools/SWTriggerUtility/README.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_


**The supported commands in the VI Gerenic Server are:**


#. 
   START_INGESTION: to start the ingestor

    Payload format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "command" : "START_INGESTION"
         }

#. 
   STOP_INGESTION: to stop the ingestor

    Payload format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "command" : "STOP_INGESTION"
         }

#. 
   SNAPSHOT: to get the frame snapshot and feed in one frame into the video data pipeline

    Payload format:

   .. code-block:: javascript

         {
           "command" : "SNAPSHOT"
         }

   ..

      **Note**\ : In order to use ``SNAPSHOT`` functionality one needs to enable the sw trigger mode and make sure ingestion should be stopped before getting the frame snapshot capture.
