``VideoIngestion Module``
=============================

The VideoIngestion(VI) module is mainly responsibly for ingesting the video frames
coming from a video source like video file or basler/RTSP/USB camera
into the EII stack for further processing. Additionally, by having VI run with
classifier and post-processing UDFs, VI can perform the job of VA(VideoAnalytics)
service also.

The high level logical flow of VideoIngestion pipeline is as below:


#. App reads the application configuration via EII Configuration Manager which
   has details of ``ingestor``\ , ``encoding`` and ``udfs``.
#. Based on the ingestor configuration, app reads the video frames from
   the video file or camera.
#. [\ ``Optional``\ ] The read frames are passed onto one or more chained native/python
   UDFs for doing any pre-processing (passing thru UDFs is an optional thing and
   not required if one doesn't want to perform any pre-processing on the
   ingested frames). With chaining of UDFs supported, one can also have
   classifier UDFs and any post-processing UDFs like resize etc., configured in
   ``udfs`` key to get the classified results. One can refer
   `../common/video/udfs/README.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_ for more details.
#. App gets the msgbus endpoint configuration from system environment and
   based on the configuration, app publishes the data on the mentioned topic
   on EII MessageBus.

----

**NOTE**\ :
Below usecases are suitable for single node deployment where one can avoid the
overhead of VA(VideoAnalytics) service.


#. If VI(VideoIngestion) service is configured with an UDF that does the
   classification, then one may choose to not to have VA service as all
   pre-processing, classification and any post-processing can be handled in VI
   itself with the usage of multiple UDFs.
#. If VI(VideoIngestion) service is using GVA(Gstreamer Video Analytics)
   elements also, then one may choose to not to have VA service as all
   pre-processing, classification and any post-processing(using vappi gstreamer
   elements) can be done in gstreamer pipeline itself. Also, the post-processing
   here can be configured by having multiple UDFs in VI if needed.

----

All the app module configuration are added into distributed key-value store
under ``AppName`` env, as mentioned in the environment section of this app's service
definition in docker-compose.

Developer mode related overrides go into docker-compose-dev.override.yml

If ``AppName`` is ``VideoIngestion``\ , then the app's config would be fetched from
``/VideoIngestion/config`` key via EII Configuration Manager.
Below is the JSON schema for app's config:

**Note**\ :

.. code-block::

   * For `jpeg` encoding type, `level` is the quality from `0 to 100` (the higher is the better)

   * For `png` encoding type, `level` is the compression level from `0 to 9`. A higher value means a smaller size and longer compression time.


One can use `JSON validator tool <https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/>`_ for validating the app configuration against the above schema.

``Ingestor config``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are the type of ingestors supported:


#. OpenCV
#. GStreamer

**Refer `docs/gstreamer_ingestor_doc.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/docs/gstreamer_ingestor_doc.html>`_ for more information/configuration on gstreamer ingestor.**

----

``Camera independent Software Trigger way of video ingestion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* 
  Software triggering way of video ingestion is a solution which enables to control video ingestion from all types of cameras, any configuration (Gstreamer & Opencv) / video files.

* 
  The regular way of video ingestion is autonomous i.e. as soon as the Video Ingestion micro-service is started the ingestion starts automatically using the video source (file/camera). There is no way to control the ingestion without stopping the ingestion micro-service itself. Software trigger feature provides a mechanism to start & stop video ingestion using software triggers sent by the client application.

----

``Generic Server in VideoIngestion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* VI generic server responds back to the client with the return values specific to the command. There is a total flexibility in sending the number & type of arguments back to client which is totally dependent on the command.


* Example JSON format for incoming payload from client to server to initialize software trigger:
  .. code-block:: javascript

     {
        "init_state" : "running"
     }

**Refer `docs/gerneric_server_doc.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/docs/generic_server_doc.html>`_ for more information/configuration on software trigger and generic server.**

----

``Gstreamer Video Analytics``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VI module supports the usage of GVA (Gstreamer Video Analytics) plugins with ``gstreamer`` ingestor. `GVA <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/dlstreamer_gst>`_ is
a collection of GStreamer elements to enable CNN model based video analytics capabilities (such as object detection, classification, recognition) in GStreamer framework.

**Refer `docs/gva_doc.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/docs/gva_doc.html>`_ for more information on GVA elements.**

**Refer `CustomUdfs-GVASafetyGearIngestion <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_ to refer GVA based CustomUdf container added for SafetyGear sample.**

**Refer `models-readme <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_ to run GVA usecase inside VI container.**

----

``Generic Plugin``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generic Plugin is a gstreamer generic source plugin that communicates and streams from a GenICam based camera which provides a GenTL producer. In order to use
the generic plugin with VI one must install the respective GenICam camera SDK and make sure the compatible GenTL producer for the camera is installed.

**Refer `src-gst-gencamsrc/README <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README>`_ for Element Properties of Generic Plugin**.

**Refer `src-gst-gencamsrc/README.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/README.html>`_ for more information on Generic Plugin**.

**Note:** For working with Genicam USB3 Vision camera please install the respective camera SDK by referring the below section.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``Adding new GigE camera support to VideoIngestion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the generic plugin with newer Genicam camera SDK follow the below steps:


#. 
   Install the respective GenICam camera SDK by adding the camera SDK installation steps in `VI-Dockerfile <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/Dockerfile>`_. The camera SDK will be installed during docker build and one can install multiple camera SDKs in `VI-Dockerfile <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/Dockerfile>`_. Refer Dokerfile reference documentation (https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/Dockerfile) for Dockerfile Instructions. Typically one would need to use ``RUN <command>`` instrcution to execute shell commands for installing newer camera sdk. In case the camera SDK cannot be downloaded in a non-interactive manner then one would need to place the camera SDK under ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/VideoIngestion/`` directory, use the ``COPY`` instruction in `VI-Dockerfile <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/Dockerfile>`_ to use the camera SDK in the build context and then use the ``RUN`` instruction for installing the camera SDK during docker build.

#. 
   After making sure the compatible GenTL producer is successfully installed one must add a case statement in `gentl_producer_env.sh <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/gentl_producer_env.sh>`_ scipt to export the GenTL producer path to ``GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH`` env variable. In order to verify the GenTL producer path one can search for the ``.cti`` file under the installation path. Typically GenTL provider is characterized by a file with ``.cti`` extension. Path to cti library containing folder must be exported to env variable named ``GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH`` (https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/gentl_producer_env.sh).

#. 
   Set ``GENICAM`` env variable in `../build/docker-compose.yml <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/docker-compose.yml>`_ to execute the corresponding case statement in `gentl_producer_env.sh <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/docker-compose.yml>`_ and export the GenTL producer path accordingly. GenTL producer path will be exported during docker runtime. Hence one can choose to add install multiple Genicam camera SDK during docker build and then switch between GenTL providers during docker runtime by modifying the ``GENICAM`` env variable in `../build/docker-compose.yml <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/docker-compose.yml>`_.

**Refer the below snippet example to select ``Basler`` camera and export its GenTL producer path in `../build/docker-compose.yml <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/docker-compose.yml>`_\ ** assuming the corresponding Basler Camera SDK and GenTL producer is installed.
