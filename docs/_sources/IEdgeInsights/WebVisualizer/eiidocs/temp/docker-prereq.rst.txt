Docker Pre-requisities
----------------------


#. 
   **Installing docker daemon and docker-compose tools with proxy settings configuration**.

   Please follow the steps mentioned in `Installing_docker_pre_requisites.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/WebVisualizer/eiidocs/temp/Installing_docker_pre_requisites.html>`_ for installing docker daemon and docker-compose tool

#. 
   **Optional:** For enabling full security, make sure host machine and docker daemon are configured with below security recommendations. `build/docker_security_recommendation.html <https://verbose-umbrella-1e93cbeb.pages.github.io/IEdgeInsights/docker_security_recommendation.html>`_

#. 
   **Optional:** If one wishes to enable log rotation for docker containers

    There are two ways to configure logging driver for docker containers


   * 
     Set logging driver as part of docker daemon (\ **applies to all docker containers by default**\ ):


     * 
       Configure ``json-file`` driver as default logging driver by following `https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/ <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/>`_. Sample json-driver config which can be copied to ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` is provided below.

       .. code-block::

            {
                "log-driver": "json-file",
                "log-opts": {
                "max-size": "10m",
                "max-file": "5"
                }
            }

     * 
       Reload the docker daemon

       .. code-block::

            $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

     * Restart docker
       .. code-block::

            $ sudo systemctl restart docker

   * 
     Set logging driver as part of docker compose which is conatiner specific and which always overwrites 1st option (i.e /etc/docker/daemon.json)

       Example to enable logging driver only for video_ingestion service:

     .. code-block::

          ia_video_ingestion:
              ...
              ...
              logging:
               driver: json-file
               options:
                max-size: 10m
                max-file: 5
