# FactoryControlApp:

This module controls the Alarm Light and Reset button.
The Output of VA (Video Analytics) i.e. the classified results data (MetaData, Frame) is published on a topic (which is mentioned in the docker compose.yml file in VA section) & the Factory control app subscribes to this topic (again sub topic mentioned in compose file of factory control app section). This meta data is parsed by the FCA & is used to determine if the frame is Defective or a proper one & glow the Red or green light in the IO module (Adam controller) respectively.

FactoryControlApp uses Message Bus Library to subscribe the output of VA (Video analytics) on the topic where VA publishes the classified data on the same topic.
The config about Adamcontroller (IO module) like port, IP address, register bits is stored in ETCD (A distributed key-value store).
