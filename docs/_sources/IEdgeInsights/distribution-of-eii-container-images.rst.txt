Distribution of EII container images
====================================

EII services are available as pre-built container images in docker hub at https://hub.docker.com/u/openedgeinsights

and for the ones not listed there, one needs to do the build from source before running ``docker-compose up -d`` command.

Eg:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
   $ # Base images that needs to be built
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_eiibase
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_common
   $ # Assuming here that the `python3 builder.py` step is been executed and ia_kapacitor
   $ # service exists in the generated compose files and also, provisioning step is done
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_kapacitor
   $ docker-compose up -d
