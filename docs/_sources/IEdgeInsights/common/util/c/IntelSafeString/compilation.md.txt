## Compilation

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX needs to be set for the build and installation:

```sh
    $ export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/opt/intel/eii"
```

The simplest sequence of commands for building the library are
shown below.

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ..
$ make
```
