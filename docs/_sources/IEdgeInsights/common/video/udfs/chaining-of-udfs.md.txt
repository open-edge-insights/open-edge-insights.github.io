## `Chaining of UDFs`

One can chain multiple native/python UDFs in the `udfs` key. The way chaining
works here is the output of the UDF listed first would send the modified frame
and metadata to the subsequent UDF and so on. One such classic example is having
`pcb.pcb_filter` and `pcb.pcb_classifier` in VideoIngestion service config to
do both the pre-processing and the classification logic without the need of
VideoAnalytics service.

### `Combination of UDFs with ingestors`

| Ingestor | Chaining UDFs for pcb demo usecase | Chaining UDFs for worker safety gear usecase |
|:--------:|:----------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| opencv/gstreamer | <br><br>Combination of resize (native), pcb filter (python) and<br>pcb classifier (python) can be used as <br>per the need.  | <br><br><br>Combination of resize (native) and worker safety gear classifier (native/python) <br> can be used as per the need.  |
| gstreamer with GVA(Gstreamer Video Analytics) elements | Not Applicable | <br>Any post-processing UDFs can be used as all<br>the pre-processing and classification is <br>happening in the gstreamer pipeline itself |

> **NOTE**:
> Dummy UDF can also be used for above use cases for testing chaining UDFs
> feature but as such there is no value add as it's a do-nothing UDF.
> In DEV Mode python udfs changes can be tested by restarting containers, no need to rebuild.
