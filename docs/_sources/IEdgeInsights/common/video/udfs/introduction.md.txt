## **Introduction**

UDFs(User Defined Function) are one of the cardinal feature of EII framework. It enables users to adjoin any pre-processing or post-processing logic in data pipeline defined by EII configuration. As of EII 2.1 release, it supports UDFs to be implemented using following languages.

* C++  (It is also called **Native** UDF as EII core components are implemented in C++)
* Python

The order in which the UDFs are defined in EII configuration file is the order in which data will flow across them. Currently there is no support for demux/mux the data flow to/fro the UDFs.

All configs related to UDFs are to be in `config.json` of apps like VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics.The UDF schema and description about keys/values in it presented in detail in the [UDF README](./README.md) file.
