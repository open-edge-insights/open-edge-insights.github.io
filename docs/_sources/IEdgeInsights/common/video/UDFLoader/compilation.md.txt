## Compilation

Utilizes CMake as the build tool for compiling the library. The simplest sequence of commands for building the library are
shown below.

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

If you wish to compile in debug mode, then you can set
the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug` when executing the `cmake` command (as shown
below).

```sh
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
