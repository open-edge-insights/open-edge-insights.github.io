## Installation

If you wish to install the EII Message Bus on your system, execute the
following command after building the library:

```sh
$ sudo make install
```

By default, this command will install the EII Message Bus C library into
`/opt/intel/eii/lib`. On some platforms this is not included in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
by default. As a result, you must add this directory to you `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
otherwise you will encounter issues using the EII Message Bus. This can
be accomplished with the following `export`:

```sh
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/intel/eii/lib
```

> **NOTE:** You can also specify a different library prefix to CMake through
> the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag. If different installation path is given via
> `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, then `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should be appended by
> $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.

### Install Python Binding

To install the Python binding for the EII Message Bus execute the following
commands:

> **NOTE:** In order for the installation to be successful, you must have run
> the `install.sh` script with the `--cython` flag when installing the
> message bus dependencies.

### Install Golang Binding

To install the Golang binding for the EII Message Bus execute the following
command:

```sh

> the target system.
