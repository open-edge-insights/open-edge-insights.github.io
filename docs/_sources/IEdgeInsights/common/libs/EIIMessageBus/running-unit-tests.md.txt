## Running Unit Tests

> **NOTE:** The unit tests will only be compiled if the `WITH_TESTS=ON` option
> is specified when running CMake.

Execute one of the following commands from the `build/tests` folder to execute
the message bus unit tests.

```sh
$ ./msgbus-tests
$ ./msg-envelope-tests
$ ./crc32-tests
```

It is important to note that the `msgbus-tests` executable has an extra CLI
option which the other unit test binaries do not have. This option allows for
running the message bus tests to run over TCP rather than the IPC.

To run the message bus tests over TCP, execute the following command:

```sh
$ ./msgbus-tests --tcp
```
