## Dependency Installation

The EII Message Bus depends on CMake version 3.11+. For Ubuntu 18.04 this is not
the default version installed via `apt-get`. To install the correct version
of CMake, execute the following commands:

```sh
# Remove old CMake version
$ sudo apt -y purge cmake
$ sudo apt -y autoremove

# Download CMake
$ wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.15/cmake-3.15.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Installation CMake
$ sudo mkdir /opt/cmake
$ sudo cmake-3.15.0-Linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/opt/cmake --skip-license

# Make the command available to all users
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cmake cmake /opt/cmake/bin/cmake 1 --force
```

To install the remaining dependencies for the message bus execute the following
command:

**Note**: It is highly recommended that you use a python virtual environment to
install the python packages, so that the system python installation doesn't
get altered. Details on setting up and using python virtual environment can
be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/

```sh
$ sudo -E ./install.sh
```

Additionally, EIIMessageBus depends on the below libraries. Follow their documentation to install them.
* [IntelSafeString](../IntelSafeString/README.md)
* [EIIMsgEnv](../EIIMsgEnv/README.md)
* [EIIUtils](../../util/c/README.md)

If you wish to compile the Python binding as well, then run the `install.sh`
script with the `--cython` flag (as shown below).

```sh
$ sudo -E ./install.sh --cython
```
