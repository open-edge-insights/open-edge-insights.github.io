## Creation of grpc .deb file (Optional)

**Note**: This is an optional as we have already created .deb file in the repo.
If user wants to create .deb file freshly, then one has to follow this step.

Navigate to `[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr` and run the `grpc_deb.sh`

```sh
$ sudo ./grpc_deb.sh
```

By executing the above script, `grpc-1.29.0-Linux.deb` will be created in
`[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/common/libs/ConfigMgr`.
