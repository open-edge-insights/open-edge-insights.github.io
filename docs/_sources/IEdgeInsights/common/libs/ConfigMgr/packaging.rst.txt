Packaging
---------

.. note::  If the build is done using the system installed gRPC, then packaging cannot be done . This is due to the various linking issues that can occur in that scenario.


This library supports being packaged as a Debian, RPM, or Alpine APK packages. This is all accomplished via CMake. By default, packaging is disabled. To enable packaging, add the ``-DPACKAGING=ON`` flag to your CMake command (see Compilation section). This command will look something like:

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -DPACKAGING=ON ..

By default, the packaging utilities will scan the system for the required
toolchains it needs to build each package type (Deb, RPM, and APK). If it does
not find the required toolsets, then it will disable that form of packaging.
The packaging utilities provide CMake flags to force packaging as any of the
supported package types. If a given package type, ex. APK, is set to be enabled
manually by its CMake flag and its required packaging toolchain does not exist,
then CMake will raise a fatal error.

The table below provides the required toolchains for each package type as well
as the CMake flag to set to ``ON`` to manually enable a packaging type:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Package Type
     - Required Tools
     - Manual Package Flag
   * - ``deb``
     - ``dpkg-deb``
     - ``PACKAGE_DEB``
   * - ``rpm``
     - ``rpmbuild``
     - ``PACKAGE_RPM``
   * - ``apk``
     - ``docker``
     - ``PACKAGE_APK``


.. note::  Manually setting a given package type to be built (e.g. setting
   ``-DPACKAGE_DEB=ON``\ ) still requires that the ``-DPACKAGING=ON`` to be set.


After the required toolchains have been installed and CMake has been run with
some combination of the packaging flags, the library can be packaged with the
following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   make package

The command above will build the Debian and RPM packages (depending on the
specified CMake flags).

To build the Alpine APK package, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

   make package-apk

**IMPORTANT:**

The Config Manager depends on the Open EII Utils and Message bus libraries.
To compile the Alpine APK package for the Config Manager it must have the APK packages for the Open EII Utils and Message bus modules.

To provide this, you must first build or download the Alpine APK package for the Open EII Utils library (see its repo `here <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-c-utils>`_
to obtain the library) and also for the Message bus (see it's repo `here <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-messagebus>`_ to obtain the library).

After you have the APKs, create an ``apks`` directory at the top level of this repository.

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir apks/

Next, place the Open EII Utils and Message bus APK packages into the, ``apks``\ ,
directory. Then run the ``make package-apk`` command. If this is not done,
then the build will fail.

A Note on Alpine APK Packaging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To package the library as an Alpine APK package, the packaging utility must use a Docker container to have access to the proper Alpine APK toolchains.
This container will automatically be built when the CMake command is ran to configure your build environment.

By default, Alpine 3.14 is used to build the package. However, this version can be changed by setting the ``APKBUILD_ALPINE_VERSION`` CMake flag to the
version of Alpine you wish to use (ex. ``-DAPKBUILD_ALPINE_VERSION=3.12``\ ).
