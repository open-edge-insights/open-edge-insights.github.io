# Interfaces

ConfigMgr parses the data from the kv store (eg: etcd) and the application environment variables for its functionality.
It supports Publisher, Subscriber, Server and Client interfaces. Below are the examples for providing 
different interfaces and different usecases.

Please refer [different ways of giving endpoints](###**Note**-"endpoint"-can-be-given-in-different-ways:)

### **Publisher Interface**

```javascript
{
    "Publishers": [
        {
            "Name": "default",
            "Type": "zmq_ipc",
            "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",
            "Topics": [
                "camera1_stream"
            ],
            "AllowedClients": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Name": "example",
            "Type": "zmq_tcp",
            "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65015",
            "Topics": [
                "*"
            ],
            "AllowedClients": [
                "Visualizer", "VideoAnalytics"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

| :-----------------: | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Publishers`         | `array`   | Yes                  | Entire publisher interface will be added with in the array. Multiple publish endpoints can be added by adding elements in the array.  |
| `Name`              | `string`  | Yes                  | Name of different publisher interfaces                   |

| `EndPoint`          | `string` or `object`  | Yes                  | In case of TCP or IPC (socket directory only), endpoint should be string as shown in the above examples. In case IPC explicitly specifying socket file, either object or string can be used for EndPoint.

| `Topics`            | `array`   | Yes                  | Specifying the topics on which data will be published on. Multiple elements in this array can denote multiple topics published on the same endpoint   |
| `AllowedClients`    | `array`   | Yes                  | Specifying who can subscribe to the the topic on which data is published. If AllowedClients is "*", then all the provisioned services can receive the data published.                  |

            "PublisherAppName": "VideoIngestion",
            // Topics cannot be "*", if the only IPC directory is given
            // if it Topics "*" to be used in ipc, then socket file should be given explicitly.
            "Topics": [
                "camera1_stream"
            ]
        }
