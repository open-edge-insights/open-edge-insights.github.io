## Installation

The EIIUtils depends on CMake version 3.11+. For Ubuntu 18.04 this is not
the default version installed via `apt-get`. To install the correct version
of CMake and other ConfigMgr dependencies, please follow [eii_libs_installer README](../../README.md)

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX needs to be set for the installation:

```sh
    $ export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/opt/intel/eii"
```

ConfigMgr installs to `/opt/intel/eii/lib/`. On some platforms this is not included in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by default. As a result, you must add this directory to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`,
otherwise you will encounter issues using the ConfigMgr. This can
be accomplished with the following `export`:

```sh
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/intel/eii/lib/
```

> **NOTE:** You can also specify a different library prefix to CMake through
> the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag. If different installation path is given via `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, then `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should be appended by $CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.
