Compilation
-----------

The Config Manager utilizes CMake as the build tool for compiling the library. The simplest sequence of commands for building the library are shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

This will compile only the C library for the ConfigMgr. To build with the Python binding, specify the ``WITH_PYTHON`` flag, when
executing the ``cmake`` command. Refer to the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -DWITH_PYTHON=ON ..

If you wish to include installation of the Go binding with the installation of the Open EII library, then specify the ``WITH_GO`` flag when executing the ``cmake``
command.

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -DWITH_GO=ON ..

.. note::  This only copies the Go binding library to your system's ``$GOPATH``. If you do not have your ``$GOPATH`` specified in your system's environmental
   variables then an error will occur while executing the ``cmake`` command.


In addition to the ``WITH_PYTHON`` and ``WITH_GO`` flags, the ConfigMgr CMake files add flags for building the C examples and the unit tests associated
with the library. The following table specifies all of the available flags that can be given to CMake for building the ConfigMgr.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Flag
     - Default
     - Description
   * - ``WITH_TESTS``
     - ``OFF``
     - If set to ``ON``\ , builds the C unit tests with the ConfigMgr compilation
   * - ``WITH_EXAMPLES``
     - ``OFF``
     - If set to ``ON``\ , then CMake will compile the C examples in addition to the library
   * - ``WITH_DOCS``
     - ``OFF``
     - If set to ``ON``\ , then CMake will add a ``docs`` build target to generate documentation


.. note:: 


   * These flags are in addition to any and all flags that are available for the ``cmake`` command. See the CMake documentation for additional flags.
   * See the `Generating Documentation <#generating-documentation>`__ section.


If you wish to compile the ConfigMgr in debug mode, then you can set the
the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` to ``Debug`` when executing the ``cmake`` command. Refer to the following:

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

Generating Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Generating the documentation has several dependencies which are not installed by the ``install.sh`` script. You must install the following packages to generate the documentation:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt install doxygen texlive-full

**Warning:** This install way take a very long time. It will install more than ``4GB`` of packages.

If you are building the Python binding by using the ``WITH_PYTHON`` flag, then you must also install Sphinx and an extension for Sphinx. This can be accomplished with the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

   sudo apt install python3-sphinx
   sudo -H -E pip3 install m2r

.. note::  The commands above assume you already have Python 3.6 and pip
   installed on your system.


**Go documentation generation is WIP.**

Once you have completed these steps, the documentation can be generated by running the following make command:

.. code-block:: sh

   make docs && make docs

.. note::  Currently you need to run ``make docs`` twice so that the table of contents is generated correctly for each of the documents. This will be fixed in the future.


The PDF documents will be in the ``docs/pdfs/`` directory within your ``build`` directory. There will be other log files and output files associated with the building of the PDFs. Any file that does not end in ``.pdf`` can be ignored.
