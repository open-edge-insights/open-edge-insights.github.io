## Running Unit Tests

> **NOTE:**

* The unit tests will only be compiled if the `WITH_TESTS=ON` option is specified when running CMake.
Please refer [Unit Test installation](###-install-configMgr-with-examples,-test-suits-and-debug-build-enabled.) installation.

* Provisioning should be done to start etcd server in dev/prod mode and to generate application specific certificates(only in prod mode).

Before executing any of the test files, please run below command from `build/tests/`
```sh
 cd ../../examples/ && source ./env.sh && cd -
```

* To run ConfigMgr unit tests
```
$ ./config_manager_unit_tests
$ ./kvstore_client-tests
```
