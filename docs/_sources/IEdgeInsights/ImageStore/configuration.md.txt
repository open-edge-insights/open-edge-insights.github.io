## `Configuration`

All the ImageStore module configuration are added into etcd (distributed
key-value data store) under `AppName` as mentioned in the
environment section of this app's service definition in docker-compose.

If `AppName` is `ImageStore`, then the app's config would look like as below
 for `/ImageStore/config` key in Etcd:
 ```
    "/ImageStore/config": {
        "minio":{
           "accessKey":"admin",
           "secretKey":"password",
           "retentionTime":"1h",
           "retentionPollInterval":"60s",
           "ssl":"false"
        }
    }
 ```
