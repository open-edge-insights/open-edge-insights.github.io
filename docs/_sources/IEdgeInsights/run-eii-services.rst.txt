Run EII services
----------------

.. note:: 

   If the images tagged with EII_VERSION as in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ does not exist locally on the system,
   they would be pulled if those images exist int he docker hub during ``docker-compose up``.


Runs all the EII services in the ``build/docker-compose.yml``

.. code-block:: sh

   $ xhost +
   $ docker-compose up -d

A successful run will open Visualizer UI with results of video analytics for all video usecases.
