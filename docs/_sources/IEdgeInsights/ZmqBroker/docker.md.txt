## Docker

The ZeroMQ Broker is integrated into the EII docker-compose ecosystem. To
build and use the Docker container, follow the defined building / provisioning
instructions for EII.

If you are using a YAML file with the `builder.py` script, then make sure
to add `ZmqBroker` under the `AppName` section of the YAML file. This will
include the broker into the resulting docker-compose.yml file and it will
include the broker's configuration into the `eii_config.json` which shall
be used when provisioning.
