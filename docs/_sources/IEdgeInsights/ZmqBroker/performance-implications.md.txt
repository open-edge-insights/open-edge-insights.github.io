## Performance Implications

When using the ZeroMQ Broker it is important to understand the implications
on the performance of the networking in the EII platform.

By using the broker, an extra network hop is incurred for all messages sent
over the EII Message Bus ZeroMQ protocol plugin. This will increase the latency
for the messages sent from the publishers connecting to the broker to the
subscribers connecting to the broker.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

Having the broker running in an EII deployment does not make every message
from publishers go through the broker. Each publisher must be configured to
connect to the broker. Publishers which are not configured to connect to the
broker will still bind to their respective IPC socket or TCP (host, port)
combination.
