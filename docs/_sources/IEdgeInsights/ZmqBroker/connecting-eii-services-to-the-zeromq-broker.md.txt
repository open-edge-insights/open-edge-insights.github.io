## Connecting EII Services to the ZeroMQ Broker

In order to connect EII Services, such as the VideoIngestion or VideoAnalytics
services, user must edit their interfaces configuration to tell them the
broker instance to connect to. Namely, you need to add two keys to the,
"Publishers", configuration to have two additional keys:

1. `BrokerAppName` - This specifies the AppName of the targeted broker instance
2. `brokered` - This tells the EII Message Bus that the given publisher instance
    is brokered

As an example, below is the changes in the interfaces configuration for enabling
the VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics to communicate via ZmqBroker.

> **NOTE:** Though the example shows VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics
> using the ZmqBroker, it is not recommended for video streaming use-cases

Changes to VideoIngestion/config.json which is a publisher.
The following adds the, "BrokerAppName", and, "brokered", keys to the default
publisher's configuration.

```javascript
    "interfaces": {
        "Publishers": [
            {
                "Name": "default",
                "Topics": [
                    "camera1_stream"
                ],
                "Type": "zmq_tcp",
                "EndPoint": "ia_zmq_broker:60514",
                "brokered": true
                "BrokerAppName": "ZmqBroker",
                "AllowedClients": [
                    "*",
                ],
            }
        ]
     }
```

For the subscriber which is VideoAnalytics, there wont be much change other than
changing the endpoint to point to ZmqBroker along with PublisherAppName.

```javascript
    "interfaces": {
        "Subscribers": [
            {
                "Name": "default",
                "Type": "zmq_tcp",
                "EndPoint": "ia_zmq_broker:60515",
                "PublisherAppName": "ZmqBroker",
                "Topics": [
                    "camera1_stream"
                ],
                "zmq_recv_hwm": 50
            }
        ]
    }
```
