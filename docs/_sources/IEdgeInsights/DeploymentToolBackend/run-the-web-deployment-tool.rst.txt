Run the Web Deployment Tool
---------------------------

Perform the steps mentioned in this section to run the Web Deployment Tool.

Run the container without building
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the container without building it, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

   cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/DeploymentToolBackend
   ./run.sh

Build and run the container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build and run the container, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh --build

or

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh -b

To build and run with --no-cache or to provide any other build argument, you can append the build argument after running the previous commands.

For example:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh --build --no-cache

.. note::  If you are building the container for the first time, the Web Deployment Tool will prompt you for the host credentials and the credentials for the SSH key generation. The host user is then added to the sudoers with the NOPASSWORD option. This is for the container to seemlessly interact with the host.


Restart the container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run any the following commands to restart the container:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh --restart

or

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh -r

Bring down the container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run any of the following commands to bring down the container:

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh --down

or

.. code-block:: shell

   ./run.sh -d
