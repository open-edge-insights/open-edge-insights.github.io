Introduction to samples of multiple UDFs in a single task and multiple tasks with single UDF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::  In this document, you will find labels of 'Edge Insights for Industrial (EII)' for filenames, paths, code snippets, and so on. Consider the references of EII as Open Edge Insights (OEI). This is due to the product name change of EII as OEI.


Implementation of 2 simple examples to showcase the use of a single task with multiple UDFs and multiple tasks with single UDF in Kapacitor.


* 
  Sample implemented in single task with multiple UDFs.
   MQTT Publisher is publishing 2 parameters (temperature and humidity). TICK script is calling 2 UDFs (one written in GO, another one in python), Go-based UDF is filtering the data based on the condition (i.e. temperature > 25), similarly for the python based UDF the condition is set to “humidity > 25”, filtered data is written back to “point_classifier_results” measurement in InfluxDB.

* 
  Sample implemented in multiple tasks with single UDF.
   MQTT Publisher is publishing 2 parameters (temperature and humidity). One TICK script is calling Go UDF, it is filtering the data based on the condition “temperature > 25” and the data is written back to “point_classifier_results” measurement.

   Second TICK script is calling python UDF, it is filtering the data based on the condition “humidity > 25” and the data is written back to “humidity_classifier_results” measurement.

* 
  Samples directory contain 3 directories, kapacitor_config which is common to both the samples and the tick scripts and eii config for each sample is kept in respective directory.
