GenICam runtime binaries error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the pipeline returns error similar below, then GenICam runtime dependency is not resolved.

.. code-block::

   module_open failed: libGenApi_gcc42_v3_1.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

In that case, download and copy the GenICam runtime binaries to standard path. The copied files are stored in the system after reboot.


#. Download this file - https://www.emva.org/wp-content/uploads/GenICam_V3_1_0_public_data.zip
#. Unzip to get runtime binaries and SDK files for multiple platforms
#. Untar GenICam_Runtime_gcc42_Linux32_i86_v3_1_0.tgz file
#. Under bin/Linux64_x64 directory, there will be shared libraries, copy all of them to usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu path

GenTL producer error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the pipeline returns error similar below, then GenTL producer is not found.

.. code-block::

   No transport layers found in path

In that case, set GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH environment variable to the GenTL producer installation path. Please install the compatible GenTL producer for the camera if not already done.

For Basler camera, the GenTL producer can be downloaded from https://www.baslerweb.com/en/sales-support/downloads/software-downloads/pylon-5-0-12-linux-x86-64-bit-debian/

Upon installation of this software, GenTL will be present in “/opt/pylon5/lib64/gentlproducer/gtl”, accordingly set the environment variable.

.. code-block::

   export GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH=/opt/pylon5/lib64/gentlproducer/gtl/

This variable may be set variable in .bashrc file so that it is one-time and need not be set every time when the terminal is opened.

Generic Plugin Element Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following are the list of properties supported by the ``gencamsrc`` gstreamer element.

  acquisition-mode    : Sets the acquisition mode of the device. It defines mainly the number of frames to capture during an acquisition and the way the acquisition stops. Possible values (continuous/multiframe/singleframe)
  balance-ratio       : Controls ratio of the selected color component to a reference color component
  balance-ratio-selector: Selects which Balance ratio to control. Possible values(All,Red,Green,Blue,Y,U,V,Tap1,Tap2...)
  balance-white-auto  : Controls the mode for automatic white balancing between the color channels. The white balancing ratios are automatically adjusted. Possible values(Off,Once,Continuous)

  binning-horizontal-mode: Sets the mode to use to combine horizontal photo-sensitive cells together when BinningHorizontal is used. Possible values (sum/average)
  binning-selector    : Selects which binning engine is controlled by the BinningHorizontal and BinningVertical features. Possible values (sensor/region0/region1/region2)
  binning-vertical    : Number of vertical photo-sensitive cells to combine together. This reduces the vertical resolution (height) of the image. A value of 1 indicates that no vertical binning is performed by the camera.
  binning-vertical-mode: Sets the mode to use to combine vertical photo-sensitive cells together when BinningHorizontal is used. Possible values (sum/average)
  black-level         : Controls the analog black level as an absolute physical value.
  black-level-auto    : Controls the mode for automatic black level adjustment. The exact algorithm used to implement this adjustment is device-specific. Possible values(Off/Once/Continuous)
  black-level-selector: Selects which Black Level is controlled by the various Black Level features. Possible values(All,Red,Green,Blue,Y,U,V,Tap1,Tap2...)
  blocksize           : Size in bytes to read per buffer (-1 = default)
  decimation-horizontal: Horizontal sub-sampling of the image.

  gain                : Controls the selected gain as an absolute value. This is an amplification factor applied to video signal. Values are device specific.
  gain-auto           : Sets the automatic gain control (AGC) mode. Possible values (off/once/continuous)
  gain-auto-balance   : Sets the mode for automatic gain balancing between the sensor color channels or taps. Possible values (off/once/continuous)

  width               : Width of the image provided by the device (in pixels).

**Notes:**


* 
  ``serial`` property is not mandatory to use if only a single camera is connected to the system. In case multiple cameras are connected to the system and the ``serial`` property is not used then the plugin will connect to the camera which is connected first in the device index list.

* 
  If ``width`` and ``height`` properties are not specified then the plugin will set to the maximum resolution supported by the camera.

* 
  ``hw-trigger-timeout`` is the time for which the plugin waits for the H/W trigger. The reason this time-out value is in multiple of 5 sec is because the maximum grab timeout for each frame is 5 secs. Hence even if ``hw-trigger-timeout=1`` is set, the plugin will wait for 5 secs.

* 
  In case frame capture is failing when multiple basler cameras are used, use the ``packet-delay`` property to increase the delay between the transmission of each packet for the selected stream channel. Depending on the number of cameras appropriate delay can be set. Increasing the ``packet-delay`` will decrease the frame rate.

* 
  The default values for ``exposure-auto`` and ``exposure-mode`` properties are ``once`` and ``timed`` respectively. To set the Exposure Time using ``exposure-time`` property, the values for ``exposure-auto`` and ``exposure-mode`` must be set to ``off`` and ``timed`` respectively. Refer the below example pipeline to set Exposure time (in us).

  $ gst-launch-1.0 gencamsrc exposure-time=1000 exposure-mode=timed exposure-auto=off ! videoconvert ! ximagesink

* 
  If ``pixel-format`` is set to any of the Bayer formats(bayerbggr/bayerrggb/bayergrbg/bayergbrg) then ``bayer2rgb`` gstreamer plugin must be used to convert raw Bayer to RGB. Refer below example for usage of ``bayer2rgb`` plugin.

  $ gst-launch-1.0 gencamsrc pixel-format=bayerrggb ! bayer2rgb ! videoconvert ! ximagesink

  Typically bayerbggr/bayerrggb/bayergrbg/bayergbrg pixel-formats are used with cameras that support BayerBG8/BayerRG8/BayerGR8/BayerGB8 respectively.

* 
  The maximum grab delay is set to 5 seconds after which the plugin would timeout and throw "No frame received from the camera" exception. This error be caused by performance problems of the network hardware used, i.e. network adapter, switch, or ethernet cable. Make sure the camera is and the system are connected to the same gigabit switch or try increasing the camera's interpacket delay using ``packet-delay`` property.

   The sample pipelines mentioned in this readme were tested using gst-launch-1.0 tool. For working with VideoIngestion service refer `VideoIngestion-README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/README.md#genicam-gige-or-usb3-camera>`_ for the ingestor configurations.
