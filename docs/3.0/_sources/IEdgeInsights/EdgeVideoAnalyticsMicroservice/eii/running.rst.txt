Running
-------

Run the following command to pull the prebuilt EII container images and Edge Video Analytics Microservice
from Docker Hub and run the containers in the detached mode:

.. code-block:: sh

   # Start the docker containers
   docker-compose up -d

.. note:: 

   The pre-built container image for Edge Video Analytics Microservice (https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/edge_video_analytics_microservice)
   gets downloaded when one runs the docker-compose up -d if the image is not already present on the host system.
