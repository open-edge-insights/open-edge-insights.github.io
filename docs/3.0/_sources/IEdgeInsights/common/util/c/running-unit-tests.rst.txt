Running Unit Tests
------------------

.. note::  The unit tests will only be compiled if the ``WITH_TESTS=ON`` option
   is specified when running CMake.


Run the following commands from the ``build/tests`` folder to cover the unit
tests.

.. code-block:: sh

   ./config-tests
   ./frame-tests
   ./log-tests
   ./thp-tests
   ./tsp-tests
