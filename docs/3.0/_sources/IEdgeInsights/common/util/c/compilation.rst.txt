Compilation
-----------

The OEI Utils utilizes CMake as the build tool for compiling the C library.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX needs to be set for the build and installation:

.. code-block:: sh

   export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/opt/intel/eii"

The simplest sequence of commands for building the library are shown below.

.. code-block:: sh

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ..
   make

If you wish to compile the OEI Utils in debug mode, then you can set
the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` to ``Debug`` when executing the ``cmake`` command (as shown
below).

.. code-block:: sh

   cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/include -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
