Overriding of Type and EndPoint
-------------------------------

In a given publisher, subscriber, client or server interfaces, the "Type" and "Endpoint" values mentioned in the respective interfaces can be overriden by setting them as env variables.

Let's take publisher as an example having multiple endpoints and below is its interface:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "Publishers": [
           {
               "Name": "default",
               "Type": "zmq_ipc",
               "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",
               "Topics": [
                   "camera1_stream"
               ],
               "AllowedClients": [
                   "*"
               ]
           },
           {
               "Name": "example",
               "Type": "zmq_tcp",
               "EndPoint": "127.0.0.1:65015",
               "Topics": [
                   "*"
               ],
               "AllowedClients": [
                   "Visualizer", "VideoAnalytics"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }

Let's say we want to override the Type ("zmq_ipc") and Endpoint ("/EII/sockets") of the first publisher's interface (interface having "Name":"default"), then env variable should be set with below syntax.

.. code-block:: sh

   export PUBLISHER_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export PUBLISHER_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

In the above command ``default`` is the ``Name`` of the interface.

Similarly, we can override subscriber's, client's and server's Type and Endpoint.

.. code-block:: sh

   export SUBSCRIBER_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export SUBSCRIBER_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

   export SERVER_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export SERVER_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

   export CLIENT_default_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export CLIENT_default_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

Let's take publisher as an example having single endpoint and below is its interface:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
       "Publishers": [
           {
               "Name": "default",
               "Type": "zmq_ipc",
               "EndPoint": "/EII/sockets",
               "Topics": [
                   "camera1_stream"
               ],
               "AllowedClients": [
                   "*"
               ]
           }
   }

If we want to override the Type ("zmq_ipc") and Endpoint ("/EII/sockets") of publisher's interface, then env variable should be set with below syntax.

.. code-block:: sh

   export PUBLISHER_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export PUBLISHER_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

Similarly, we can override subscriber's, client's and server's Type and Endpoint.

.. code-block:: sh

   export SUBSCRIBER_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export SUBSCRIBER_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

   export SERVER_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export SERVER_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

   export CLIENT_TYPE="zmq_tcp"
   export CLIENT_ENDPOINT="127.0.0.1:65013"

Overriding feature of ConfigMgr will be used in orchestrated scenarios including Kubernetes.
