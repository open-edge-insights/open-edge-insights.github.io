Running Unit Tests
------------------

.. note:: 


   * The unit tests will only be compiled if the ``WITH_TESTS=ON`` option is specified when running CMake. Refer `Unit Test installation <#-install-configmgr-with-examples,-test-suits-and-debug-build-enabled.>`__ installation.
   * Provisioning should be done to start etcd server in the Dev or the Prod mode and to generate application specific certificates (only in prod mode).


Before executing any of the test files, run the followins command from ``build/tests/``\ :

.. code-block:: sh

    cd ../../examples/ && source ./env.sh && cd -


* To run ConfigMgr unit tests

.. code-block:: sh

   ./config_manager_unit_tests
   ./kvstore_client-tests
