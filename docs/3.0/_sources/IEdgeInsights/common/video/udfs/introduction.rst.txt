Introduction
------------

UDFs(User Defined Function) are one of the cardinal feature of Open EII framework. It enables users to adjoin any pre-processing or post-processing logic in data pipeline defined by Open EII configuration. As of Open EII 2.1 release, it supports UDFs to be implemented using following languages.


* C++  (It is also called **Native** UDF as Open EII core components are implemented in C++)
* Python

The order in which the UDFs are defined in Open EII configuration file is the order in which data will flow across them. Currently there is no support for demux/mux the data flow to/fro the UDFs.

All configs related to UDFs are to be in ``config.json`` of apps like VideoIngestion and VideoAnalytics.The UDF schema and description about keys/values in it presented in detail in the `UDF README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/blob/master/udfs/README.md>`_ file.
