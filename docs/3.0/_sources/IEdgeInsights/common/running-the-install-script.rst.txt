Running the install script
--------------------------

**Note:**


* 
  The installer needs specific versions of grpc and protobuf to be installed.
  If these libraries are already present in the ``/usr/local/lib`` or at the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` env location, the installation will skip building and installing the libraries. It is recommended to remove grpc before proceeding, as it can cause version conflicts.

  .. code-block:: sh

       sudo apt-get remove --auto-remove --purge -y grpc

* 
  Also, ensure that all the OEI occurrences are removed from ``/usr/local/lib`` and ``/usr/local/include``

Install OEI libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


#. 
   To install all of OEI libraries and their dependencies, run the following commands:

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo apt-get update

    For Ubuntu-20.04

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo apt-get install -y libcjson-dev libzmq3-dev zlib1g-dev

    For Ubuntu-18.04

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo apt-get install -y libjson-c-dev libzmq3-dev zlib1g-dev

   .. code-block:: sh

       mkdir -p /opt/intel/eii/
       sudo -E CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/opt/intel/eii" ./eii_libs_installer.sh

   ..

      **Note:** During the execution of ``eii_libs_installer.sh``\ , if any $GOPATH-related error occurs then, set the ``GOPATH`` appropriately, where GO is installed. Ideally, the above script will take care of the GO installation and setting up the path. If GO is already installed, and GOPATH is tampered, then ensure to set GOPATH appropriately.


#. 
   For unforeseen errors leading to unsuccessful installation, run the following command to cleanup any or all untracked tar files:

   .. code-block:: sh

           sudo git clean -xdf

#. 
   Complete the following steps to set the required env variables while running in bare metal:

    a. For updating the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH env variable:

   .. code-block:: sh

           export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/intel/eii/lib
           export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
           export GOPATH=~/go

   ..

      **Note:** ``$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` should be appended by ``$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib``. In the above installation CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is ``/opt/intel/eii`` and hence LD_LIBRARY_PATH appended with /opt/intel/eii/lib


    b. For updating the $no_proxy env variable to connect to etcd:

   .. code-block:: sh

           export no_proxy=$no_proxy,127.0.0.1
