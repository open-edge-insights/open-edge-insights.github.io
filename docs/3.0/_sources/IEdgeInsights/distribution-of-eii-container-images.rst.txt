Distribution of EII container images
====================================

EII services are available as pre-built container images in docker hub at https://hub.docker.com/u/openedgeinsights

Below are the list of pre-built container images that are accessible at https://hub.docker.com/u/openedgeinsights:


#. 
   **Provisioning images**


   * openedgeinsights/ia_etcd_provision
   * openedgeinsights/ia_etcd

#. 
   **Common EII images applicable for video and timeseries use cases**


   * openedgeinsights/ia_etcd_ui
   * openedgeinsights/ia_influxdbconnector
   * openedgeinsights/ia_rest_export
   * openedgeinsights/ia_opcua_export

#. 
   **Video pipeline images**


   * openedgeinsights/ia_video_ingestion
   * openedgeinsights/ia_video_analytics
   * openedgeinsights/ia_web_visualizer
   * openedgeinsights/ia_visualizer
   * openedgeinsights/ia_imagestore
   * openedgeinsights/ia_azure_bridge
   * openedgeinsights/ia_azure_simple_subscriber

#. 
   **Timeseries pipeline images**


   * openedgeinsights/ia_grafana

Additionally, we have ``openedgeinsights/ia_edgeinsights_src`` image available at the above docker hub
location which consists of source code of GPL/LGPL/AGPL components of EII stack.

For the EII docker images not listed on docker hub at above location, one needs to do the build from source
before running ``docker-compose up -d`` command or bringing up the pod in kubernetes cluster on the build/development
node.

Eg:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ # Update the DOCKER_REGISTRY value in [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env as DOCKER_RESISTRY=<docker_registry> (Make sure `docker login <docker_registry>` to the docker reigstry works)
   $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build
   $ # Base images that needs to be built
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_eiibase
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_common
   $ # Assuming here that the `python3 builder.py` step is been executed and ia_kapacitor
   $ # service exists in the generated compose files and also, provisioning step is done
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yml build ia_kapacitor
   $ docker-compose up -d
   $ # Push all the applicable EII images to <docker_registry>. Ensure to use the same DOCKER_REGISTRY value on the deployment machine while deployment
   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-push.yml push
