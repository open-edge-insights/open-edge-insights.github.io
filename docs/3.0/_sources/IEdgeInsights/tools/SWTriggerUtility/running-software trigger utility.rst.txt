Running Software Trigger Utility
--------------------------------


#. 
   EII services can be running in prod or dev mode by setting ``DEV_MODE`` value accordingly in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_

#. 
   Execute builder.py script:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/
      $ python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming.yml

   **NOTE**\ : The same yml file to which the **SWTriggerUtility** entry was added in `pre-requisites <#software-trigger-utilily-pre-requisites>`__ has to be selected while running `pre-requisites <#software-trigger-utilily-pre-requisites>`__

#. 
   Run provisioning step as below:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/provision
      $ sudo -E ./provision.sh  ../docker-compose.yml
