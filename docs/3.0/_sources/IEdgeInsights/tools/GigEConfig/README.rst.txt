GigEConfig tool
---------------

The GigEConfig tool can be used to read the Basler Camera properties from the Pylon Feature Stream file and construct a gstreamer pipeline with the required camera features. The gstreamer pipeline which is generated by the tool can either be printed on the console or can be used to update the config manager storage.

.. note:: 


   * This tool has been verified with Basler camera only as the PFS file which is a pre-requisite to this tool is specific to Basler Pylon Camera Software Suite.
   * In this document, you will find labels of 'Edge Insights for Industrial (EII)' for filenames, paths, code snippets, and so on. Consider the references of EII as Open Edge Insights (OEI). This is due to the product name change of EII as OEI.


Generating PFS (Pylon Feature Stream) File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to execute this tool user has to provide a PFS file as a pre-requisite. The PFS file can be generated using the Pylon Viwer application for the respective Basler camera by following below steps:-


#. 
   Refer the below link to install and get an overview of the Pylon Viewer application:-
    https://docs.baslerweb.com/overview-of-the-pylon-viewer

#. 
   Execute the below steps to run the Pylon Viewer application:

   .. code-block:: sh

         sudo <PATH>/pylon5/bin/PylonViewerApp

#. 
   Using the Pylon Viewer application follow below steps to gererate a PFS file for the required camera.


   * Select the required camera and open it
   * Configure the camera  with the required settings if required
   * On the application toolbar, select Camera tab-> Save Features..
   * Close the camera

.. note:: \ In case one needs to configure the camera using Pylon Viewer make sure the device is not used by another application as it can be controlled by only one application at a time.


Running GigEConfig Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before executing the tool make sure following steps are executed:-


#. 
   Refer `GenICam GigE Camera <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion#genicam-gige-or-usb3-camera>`_ and follow the pre-requisities required to work with Basler GenICam GigE cameras and make sure provisioning is done by referring `Configmgr Readme <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-configmgr-agent/blob/master/README.md>`_

#. 
   Source build/.env to get all the required ENVs

   .. code-block:: sh

       set -a
       source [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/.env
       set +a

#. 
   Install the dependencies:

   **Note:** It is highly recommended that you use a python virtual environment to
   install the python packages, so that the system python installation doesn't
   get altered. Details on setting up and using python virtual environment can
   be found here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/

   .. code-block:: sh

       cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/tools/GigEConfig
       pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#. 
   If using GigE tool in PROD mode, make sure to set required permissions to certificates.

   .. code-block:: sh

           sudo chmod -R 755 [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/Certificates

   ..

      **Note:** This step is required everytime provisioning is done.
      Caution: This step will make the certs insecure. Please do not do it on a production machine.

----

`config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-tools/blob/master/GigEConfig/config.json>`_ consist of mapping between the PFS file elements and the camera properties. The pipeline constructed will only consist of the elements specified in it.

The user needs to provide following elements:-


* 
  pipeline_constant: Specify the constant gstreamer element of pipeline.

* 
  plugin_name: The name of the gstreamer source plugin used

* 
  device_serial_number: Serial number of the device to which the plugin needs to connect to:

* 
  plugin_properties: Properties to be integrated in pipeline, The keys in here are mapped to respective gstreamer properties

#. 
   .. code-block:: sh

      cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/tools/GigEConfig

#.

#. 
   In case etcd configuration needs to be updated.
