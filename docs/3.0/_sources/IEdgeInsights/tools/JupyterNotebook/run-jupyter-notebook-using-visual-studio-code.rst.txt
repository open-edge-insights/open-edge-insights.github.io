Run Jupyter Notebook using Visual Studio Code
---------------------------------------------

Perform the following steps to use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to develop a UDF:


#. 
   In the terminal, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

           python3 builder.py -f usecases/video-streaming.yml

#. 
   Refer the `IEdgeInsights/README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md>`_ to provision, build and run the tool along with the OEI recipe or stack.

#. 
   To see the logs, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

           docker logs -f ia_jupyter_notebook

#. 
   In the consolidated ``build/docker-compose.yml`` file, for the ``ia_jupyter_notebook`` service, change ``read_only: true`` to ``read_only: false``.

#. Run the ``docker-compose up -d ia_jupyter_notebook`` command.
#. In VS Code, install the ``Remote - Containers`` extension.
#. Using the shortcut key combination ``(Ctrl+Shift+P)`` access the Command Palette.
#. In the Command Palette, run the ``Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container`` command.
#. Select the ``ia_jupyter_notebook`` container.
#. In the ``ia_jupyter_notebook`` container, install the ``Python`` and ``Jupyter`` extensions.
#. 
   In the Command Palette, run the ``Jupyter: Specify Jupyter server for connections`` command.

   ..

      **Note:**
      If the ``Jupyter: Specify Jupyter server for connections`` command is not available, then run the ``Jupyter: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections`` command.


#. 
   Choose ``Existing: Specify the URI of an existing server`` when prompted to select how to connect to Jupyter Notebook.

#. Enter the server's URI (hostname) with the authentication token (included with a ?token= URL parameter), when prompted to enter the URI of a Jupyter server. Refer to the sample URL mentioned in the previous procedure.
#. Open the ``/home/eiiuser`` folder to update the respective udf_template and the main notebooks and re-run.
#. To create a Jupyter notebook, run the ``Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook`` command in the Command Palette.
#. To save the UDF, go to **More Actions (...)**\ , and then, select **Export**.
#. When prompted **Export As**\ , select **Python Script**.
#. From the **File** menu, click **Save As**.
#. Select **Show Local**.
#. Enter the name and save the file.

.. note:: 

   You cannot upload files to the workspace in VS Code due to the limitation with the Jupyter Notebook plugin. To use this functionality, access the Jupyter notebook through a web browser.
