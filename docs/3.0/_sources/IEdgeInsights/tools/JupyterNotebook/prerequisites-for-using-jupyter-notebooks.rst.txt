Prerequisites for using Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------------------------------

The following are the prerequisites for using Jupyter Notebook to develop UDFs:


* 
  Jupyter Notebook requires a set of configs, interfaces, and the public and private keys to be present in `IEdgeInsights <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_. To meet this prerequisite, ensure that an entry for Jupyter Notebook with its relative path from the ``[IEdgeInsights](https://github.com/open-edge-insights/)`` directory is set in any of the ``.yml`` files present in the `IEdgeInsights <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_ directory.


  * 
    Refer the following example to add the entry in the `video-streaming.yml <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/tree/master/build/usecases/video-streaming.yml>`_ file.

    .. code-block:: yml

           AppContexts:
           ---snip---
           - tools/JupyterNotebook

* 
  Ensure that in the config of either ``VideoIngestion`` or ``VideoAnalytics`` the `jupyter_connector <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/tree/master/udfs/python/jupyter_connector.py>`_ UDF is enabled to connect to Jupyter Notebook. Refer the following example to connect ``VideoIngestion`` to ``JupyterNotebook``. Change the config in the `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/config.json>`_\ :

  .. code-block:: javascript

           {
               "config": {
                   "encoding": {
                       "type": "jpeg",
                       "level": 95
                   },
                   "ingestor": {
                       "type": "opencv",
                       "pipeline": "./test_videos/pcb_d2000.avi",
                       "loop_video": true,
                       "queue_size": 10,
                       "poll_interval": 0.2
                   },
                   "sw_trigger": {
                       "init_state": "running"
                   },
                   "max_workers":4,
                   "udfs": [{
                       "name": "jupyter_connector",
                       "type": "python",
                       "param1": 1,
                       "param2": 2.0,
                       "param3": "str"
                   }]
               }
           }
