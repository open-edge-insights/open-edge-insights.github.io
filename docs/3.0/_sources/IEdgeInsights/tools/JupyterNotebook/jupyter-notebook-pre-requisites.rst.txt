Jupyter Notebook pre-requisites
-------------------------------


#. 
   Jupyter Notebook expects a set of config, interfaces & public private keys to be present in ETCD as a pre-requisite.


   * To achieve this, please ensure an entry for Jupyter Notebook with its relative path from `IEdgeInsights <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_ directory is set in any of the .yml files present in `IEdgeInsights <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/>`_ directory.
   * An example has been provided below to add the entry in `video-streaming.yml <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/tree/master/build/usecases/video-streaming.yml>`_
     .. code-block:: yml

          AppContexts:
          ---snip---
          - tools/JupyterNotebook

#. 
   Ensure the `jupyter_connector <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-common/tree/master/udfs/python/jupyter_connector.py>`_ UDF is enabled in the config of either **VideoIngestion** or **VideoAnalytics** to be connected to JupyterNotebook. An example has been provided here for connecting **VideoIngestion** to **JupyterNotebook**\ , the config to be changed being present at `config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-ingestion/blob/master/config.json>`_\ :

   .. code-block:: javascript
