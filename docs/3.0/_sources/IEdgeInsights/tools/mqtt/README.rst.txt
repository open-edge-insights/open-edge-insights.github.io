MQTT publisher
--------------

MQTT publisher is a tool to help publish the sample sensor data.

.. note::  In this document, you will find labels of 'Edge Insights for Industrial (EII)' for filenames, paths, code snippets, and so on. Consider the references of EII as Open Edge Insights (OEI). This is due to the product name change of EII as OEI.


Usage
^^^^^

.. note::  This assumes you have already installed and configured Docker.



#. Provision, build and bring up the OEI stack by following in the steps in the `README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md>`_.

**Note** By default the tool publishes temperature data. If the user wants to publish other data, he/she needs to modify the command option in "ia_mqtt_publisher" service in `build/docker-compose.yml <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/docker-compose.yml>`_ accordingly and recreate the container using ``docker-compose up -d`` command from build directory.


* 
  To publish temperature data to default topic, command option by default is set to:

  .. code-block:: sh

       ["--temperature", "10:30"]

* 
  To publish temperature and humidity data together, change the command option to:

  .. code-block:: sh

      ["--temperature", "10:30", "--humidity", "10:30", "--topic_humd", "temperature/simulated/0"]

* 
  To publish multiple sensor data(temperature, pressure, humidity) to default topic(temperature/simulated/0, pressure/simulated/0, humidity/simulated/0),change the command option to:

  .. code-block:: sh

      ["--temperature", "10:30", "--pressure", "10:30", "--humidity", "10:30"]

* 
  To publish differnt topic instead of default topic, change the command option to:

  .. code-block:: sh

      ["--temperature", "10:30", "--pressure", "10:30", "--humidity", "10:30", "--topic_temp", <temperature topic>, "--topic_pres", <pressure topic>, "--topic_humd", <humidity topic>]

  It is possible to publish more than one sensor data into single topic, in that case, same topic name needs to be given for that sensor data.

* 
  For publishing data from csv row by row, change the command option to:

  .. code-block:: sh

      ["--csv", "demo_datafile.csv", "--sampling_rate", "10", "--subsample", "1"]

* 
  To publish JSON files (to test random forest UDF), change the command option to:

  .. code-block:: sh

      ["--topic", "test/rfc_data", "--json", "./json_files/*.json", "--streams", "1"]


#. 
   If one wish to see the messages going over MQTT, run the subscriber with the following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

       ./subscriber.sh <port>

    Example:
    If Broker runs at port 1883, to run subscriber use following command:

   .. code-block:: sh

       ./subscriber.sh 1883
