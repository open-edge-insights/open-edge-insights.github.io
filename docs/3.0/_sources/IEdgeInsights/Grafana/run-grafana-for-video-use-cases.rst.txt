Run Grafana for video use cases
-------------------------------

Perform the following steps to run Grafana for a video use case:


#. Ensure that the endpoint of the publisher, that you want to subscribe to, is mentioned in the **Subscribers** section of the `config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/ts-grafana/blob/master/config.json>`_ file.
#. On the **Home Dashboard** page, on the left corner, click the Dashboards icon.
#. Click the **Manage Dashboards** tab, to view the list of all the preconfigured dashboards.
#. Select **EII Video and Time Series Dashboard**\ , to view multiple panels with topic names of the subscriber as the panel names along with a time-series panel named ``Time Series``.
#. Hover over the topic name. The panel title will display multiple options.
#. Click **View** to view the subscribed frames for each topic.

.. note:: 


   #. The only supported browser for Grafana support for video usecase is **Google Chrome**.
   #. Changing gridPos for the video frame panels is prohibited since these values are altered internally to support multi instance.
   #. Since Grafana does not run as EII_USER due to permission issues in creating Grafana certs internally, it currently does not support susbcribing to EII services in IPC mode.
   #. Grafana does not support visualization for GVA streams.
   #. Grafana currently supports running a maximum number of **12 streams** only.
