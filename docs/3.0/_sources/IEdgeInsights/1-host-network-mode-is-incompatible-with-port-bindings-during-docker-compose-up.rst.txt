Issue in starting InfluxDBConnector, Kapacitor and Grafana Services like InfluxDBConnector, Kapacitor, Grafana whose ports are exposed to start the service might fail to start during ``docker-compose up``.


* 
  Error description:

  ERROR: for ia_kapacitor  "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings

  ERROR: for ia_grafana  "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings

  ERROR: for ia_influxdbconnector "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings

  docker.errors.InvalidArgument: "host" network_mode is incompatible with port_bindings

* 
  Possible Cause:

  docker-compose might have been installed using "pip" where version mismatch might be causing the issue.

* 
  Solution:

  Installation of docker-compose using "curl" as mentiond in `Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/Installing_docker_pre_requisites.md>`_ will solve the
  issue. Also, following the below command should solve the issue.

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     pip3 uninstall docker-compose
     sudo curl L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-`uname -s``uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
