GVASafetyGearIngestion
----------------------

Following the steps mentioned in this document, the `GVASafetyGearIngestion-README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-custom-udfs/blob/master/GVASafetyGearIngestion/README.md>`_ UDF container is added. It is a GVA-based UDF container based out of the VI container. For more information on the UDF configs, refer to `GVASafetyGearIngestion-README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-custom-udfs/blob/master/GVASafetyGearIngestion/README.md>`_.

..

   **Notes:**


   * Analytics operation is performed using the constructed gstreamer pipeline using the GVA plugin elements. It is not mandatory to have a UDF parameter in the config and have an analytics container. The classified results can be directly subscribed from the GVA ingestion container.
   * The model files which are provided to the GVA plugin elements should be copied in the container to the ``./models`` directory path.


  **Example:** Refer to the `GVASafetyGearIngestion-Dockerfile <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-custom-udfs/blob/master/GVASafetyGearIngestion/Dockerfile>`_ snippet below:

.. code-block:: Dockerfile


     ----snippet----
     COPY ./ref ./models/ref

  Here the models files placed under the ``ref`` directory on the host system is copied to the ``./models/ref`` path in the container.
