Provision OEI in the kubernetes node
------------------------------------

.. note::  Make sure you have ``deleted`` older certificates.


   a. Execute ``eii-provision`` chart to provision OEI

.. code-block:: sh

     cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/helm-eii
     helm install eii-provision eii-provision/

   b. Update permission of certificates dir incase of ``PROD`` mode

.. code-block:: sh

     cd [WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/helm-eii/
     sudo chmod -R 777 eii-deploy/Certificates

.. note:: 
   The Certificates/ directory contains sensitive information. So post the installation of eii-provision helm chart, it is recommended to delete the Certificates from it.
