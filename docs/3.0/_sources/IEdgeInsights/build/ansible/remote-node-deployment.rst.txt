Remote node deployment
----------------------

Below configuration changes need to be made for remote node deployment without k8s


#. Single node deployment all the services based on the ``usecase`` chosen will be deployed.
#. 
   Update ``docker`` registry details in following section if using a custom/private registry

   .. code-block:: sh

           docker_registry="<regsitry_url>"
           docker_login_user="<username>"
           docker_login_passwd="<password>"

   ..

      **Note**
      Use of ``docker_registry`` and ``build`` flags are as follows:


      * Update the ``docker_registry`` details to use docker images from custom registry, optionally set ``build: true`` to push docker images to this registry
      * Unset the ``docker_registry`` details if you don't want to use custom registry and set ``build: true`` to save and load docker images from one node to another node


#. 
   If you are using images from docker hub, then set ``build: false`` and unset ``docker_registry`` details
