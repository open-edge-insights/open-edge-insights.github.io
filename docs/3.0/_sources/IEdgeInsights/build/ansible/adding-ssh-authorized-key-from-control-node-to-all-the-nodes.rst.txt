Adding SSH Authorized Key from control node to all the nodes
------------------------------------------------------------

Please follow the steps to copy the generated keys from control node to all other nodes

Execute the following command from ``control`` node.

.. code-block:: sh

       ssh-copy-id <USER_NAME>@<HOST_IP>

For Eg.

.. code-block:: sh

       $ ssh-copy-id test@192.0.0.1

       /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/<username>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

       Number of key(s) added: 1

       Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'test@192.0.0.1'"
       and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

Configure Sudoers file to accept NO PASSWORD for sudo operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note:: 
   Ansible need to execute some commands as ``sudo``. The below configuration is needed so that ``passwords`` need not be saved in the ansible inventory file ``hosts``


Update ``sudoers`` file


#. 
   Open the ``sudoers`` file.

   .. code-block:: sh

           sudo visudo

#. 
   Append the following to the ``sudoers`` file

   ..

      **Note**
      Please append to the last line of the ``sudoers`` file.


   .. code-block:: sh

          <ansible_non_root_user>  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

   For E.g:

   If in control node, the current non root user is ``user1``\ , you should append as follows

   .. code-block:: sh

         user1 ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

#. 
   Save & Close the file

#. 
   For checking the ``sudo`` access for the enabled ``user``\ , please logout and login to the session again
   check the following command.

   .. code-block:: sh

         sudo -l -U <ansible_non_root_user>

   Now the above line authorizes ``user1`` user to do ``sudo`` operation in the control node without ``PASSWORD`` ask.

   ..

      **Note**
      The same procedure applies to all other nodes where ansible connection is involved.
