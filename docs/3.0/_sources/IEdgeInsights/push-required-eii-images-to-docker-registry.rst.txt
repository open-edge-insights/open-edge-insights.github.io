Push required EII images to docker registry
-------------------------------------------

.. note:: 
   By default, the images gets published to hub.docker.com if DOCKER_REGISTRY is empty in `build/.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_. Please make sure to take off
   ``openedgeinsights/`` org from the image name(s) while pushing to docker hub as it doesn't support repository/image name having multiple slashes.
   This limitation doesn't exist in other docker registries like Azure Container Registry(ACR), Harbor registry etc.,


Pushes all the EII service docker images in the ``build/docker-compose-push.yml``. Ensure to update the DOCKER_REGISTRY value in `.env <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/build/.env>`_ file.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ docker-compose -f docker-compose-push.yml push
