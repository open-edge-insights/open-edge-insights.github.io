Configuration
-------------

Please see the `edge-video-analytics-microservice/eii/config.json <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/eii/config.json>`_ file for the configuration of the
Edge Video Analytics Microservice. The default configuration will start the
object_detection demo for EII.

The config file is divided in two sections listed below:

Config
^^^^^^

The table below describes each of the attributes currently
supported in config section.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
     - Description
   * - ``cert_type``
     - Type of EII certs to be created, must be ``"zmq"`` or ``"pem"``.
   * - ``source``
     - Source of the frames, must be ``"gstreamer"`` or ``"msgbus"``.
   * - ``source_parameters``
     - The parameters for the source element. The provided object is the typical parameters.
   * - ``pipeline``
     - The name of the DL Streamer pipeline to use (should correspond to a directory in the pipelines directory).
   * - ``pipeline_version``
     - The version of the pipeline to use. This typically is a subdirectory of a pipeline in the pipelines directory.
   * - ``publish_frame``
     - Boolean flag for whether to publish the meta-data and the analyzed frame, or just the meta-data.
   * - ``model_parameters``
     - Provides the parameters for the model used for inference.


Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^

In EII mode, the microservice only supports launching a single pipeline and publishing on a
single topic currently. This means, in the configuration file ("config.json"),
the single JSON object in the ``Publisher`` list is where the configuration
resides for the published data. See the `EII documentation <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md#adding-new-eii-service-so-it-gets-picked-up-by-builder>`_ for more details on
the structure of this.

The Edge Video Analytics Microservice also supports subscribing and publishing messages/frames
using the EII_Message_Bus.
The endpoint details for the EII service you need to subscribe from is to be
provided in the **Subscribers** section in `config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/eii/config.json>`_ and the endpoints
where you need to publish to are to be provided in **Publishers** section in
`config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/eii/config.json>`_.

For enabling injection of frames into the GStreamer pipeline obtained from
EIIMessageBus, please ensure the following changes are made:


* 
  The source parameter in `config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/eii/config.json>`_ is set to msgbus

  .. code-block:: javascript

       "config": {
           "source": "msgbus"
       }

* 
  The template of respective pipeline is set to appsrc as source instead of uridecodebin

.. code-block:: javascript

       {
           "type": "GStreamer",
           "template": ["appsrc name=source",
                        " ! rawvideoparse",
                        " ! appsink name=destination"
                       ]
       }
