Pre-requisites
--------------

Fetch the EII source code by following the steps mentioned below:

.. code-block:: sh

   repo init -u "https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests.git"

   repo sync

For more details, refer `here <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests>`_.

Complete the pre-requisite of provisioning the EII stack by referring to
`README.md <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-core/blob/master/README.md#provision>`_ 

Since the model files are large in size, they are not part of the repo.
Download the required model files to be used for the pipeline mentioned in `config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/eii/config.json>`_
by following the first four steps mentioned in `README <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/edge-video-analytics-microservice/blob/master/README.md#running-the-image>`_.

Run the following commands to set the environment, build ia_configmgr_agent container
and copy models to the required directory:

.. code-block:: sh

   cd [WORK_DIR]/IEdgeInsights/build

   # Execute the builder.py script
   python3 builder.py -f usecases/evas.yml

   # Create some necessary items for the service
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel/eii/models/

   # Copy the downloaded model files to /opt/intel/eii
   sudo cp -r models /opt/intel/eii/
