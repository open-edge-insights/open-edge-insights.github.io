Configuration
-------------

All the ImageStore module configuration are added into etcd (distributed
key-value data store) under ``AppName`` as mentioned in the
environment section of this app's service definition in docker-compose.

If ``AppName`` is ``ImageStore``\ , then the app's config would look like as below
 for ``/ImageStore/config`` key in Etcd:

.. code-block::

       "/ImageStore/config": {
           "minio":{
              "accessKey":"admin",
              "secretKey":"password",
              "retentionTime":"1h",
              "retentionPollInterval":"60s",
              "ssl":"false"
           }
       }
