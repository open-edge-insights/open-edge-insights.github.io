Reference URL for issue tracking (JIRA/HSD/Github): **\\ :raw-html-m2r:`<URL to be filled>`\ **


* [ ] **\ *Added label to the Pull Request following the template: ISDM\*\ \\ :raw-html-m2r:`<Complexity>`\ *_** \
    Note-1: Depending on complexity of code changes, use the suitable word for complexity: Low/Medium/High \
    Example: PR for Slim boot loader project with medium complexity can have the label as: ISDM_Medium
* [ ] Added label to the Pull Request for easier discoverability and search

CODE MAINTAINABILITY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [ ] **\ *Every commit is a single defect fix and does not mix feature addition or changes**\ **
* [ ] Added required tests -> Added required new tests relevant to the changes

  * [ ] PR contains URL links to functional tests executed with the new tests 

* [ ] Updated relevant documentation
* [ ] Updated build steps/commands
* [ ] PR change contains code related to security
* [ ] PR introduces breaking change. (If YES, please provide description)
* [ ] Specific instructions or information for code reviewers (If any):

Maintainer Mandatory (to be filled by PR Reviewer/Approving Maintainer)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


* Maintainer who approves the Pull Request for merge is required to mark the checklist below as appropriate for the PR change reviewed as key proof of attestation indicating reasons for merge. 
* Those checklist items which are not marked are considered as not applicable for the PR change. 
* Items marked with an asterisk suffix are mandatory items to check and if not marked will be treated as non-compliant pull requests by the maintainers for ISDM compliance.

QUALITY CHECKS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* [ ] Architectural and Design Fit
* [ ] **\ *Quality of code (At least one should be checked as applicable)**\ **

  * [ ] Commit Message meets guidelines
  * [ ] PR changes adhere to industry practices and standards
  * [ ] Upstream expectations are met
  * [ ] Adopted domain specific coding standards
  * [ ] Error and exception code paths implemented correctly
  * [ ] Code reviewed for domain or language specific anti-patterns
  * [ ] Code is adequately commented
  * [ ] Code copyright is correct
  * [ ] Tracing output are minimized and logic
  * [ ] Confusing logic is explained in comments
  * [ ] Commit comment can be used to design a new test case for the changes

* [ ] **\ *Test coverage shows adequate coverage with required CI functional tests pass on all supported platforms**\ **
* [ ] **\ *Static code scan report shows zero critical issues**\ **

CODE REVIEW IMPACT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


* Summary of Defects Detected in Code Review: **\<%P1\ *xx,P2*\ xx,P3\ *xx,P4*\ xx%>** \
  Note P1/P2/P3/P4 denotes severity of defects found (Showstopper/High/Medium/Low) and xx denotes number of defects found

SECURITY CHECKS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:


* [ ] Avoid checks that rely on the result of undefined C behavior.
  Instead, clarify the check condition using defined behaviors. Example: ``if (x > INT_MAX-100)`` instead of ``if (x + 100 < x)``
* [ ] Use safe arithmetic to avoid integer overflow.
* [ ] Follow best practices when handling primitive data types
* [ ] Follow security best practices when dealing with pointers
* [ ] Avoid uncontrolled format strings
* [ ] Prevent buffer overflow/underflow
* [ ] Avoid unsafe functions
* [ ] Configure minimal permissions when opening pipes and ports
* [ ] Check contents within input structures are valid before use
* [ ] All forms of input validated
* [ ] Avoid inter-process race conditions
* [ ] Error and exception handling implemented
* [ ] Use keywords and #pragma to constrain gcc compiler optimization
* [ ] Prevent compiler from optimizing out security checks
