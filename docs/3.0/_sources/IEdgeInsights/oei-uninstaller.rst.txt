OEI Uninstaller
---------------

The OEI uninstaller script automates the removal of all the OEI Docker configuration that are installed on a system. The uninstaller performs the following tasks:


* Stops and removes all the OEI running and stopped containers.
* Removes all the OEI docker volumes.
* Removes all the OEI docker images [Optional]
* Removes all OEI install directory

To run the uninstaller script, run the following commmand from the ``[WORKDIR]/IEdgeInsights/build/`` directory

.. code-block:: sh

   ./eii_uninstaller.sh -h

Usage: ./eii_uninstaller.sh [-h] [-d]
This script uninstalls the previous OEI version.
Where:
    -h show the help
    -d triggers the deletion of docker images (by default it will not trigger)
Example:


* 
  Run the following command to delete the OEI containers and volumes:

  .. code-block:: sh

         ./eii_uninstaller.sh

* 
  Run the following command to delete the OEI containers, volumes, and images:

  .. code-block:: sh

       export EII_VERSION=2.4
       ./eii_uninstaller.sh -d

The commands in the example will delete the version 2.4 OEI containers, volumes, and all the docker images.
