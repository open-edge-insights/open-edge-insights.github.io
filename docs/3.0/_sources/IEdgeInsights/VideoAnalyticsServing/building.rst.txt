Building
--------

The Docker container for this service cannot be built by itself. It must be
built in the context of the EII multi-repo project. Follow the instructions
`here <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/eii-manifests>`_.

Since the model files are large in size, they are not part of the repo.
Download the required model files to be used for the pipeline mentioned in 
`config <https://github.com/open-edge-insights/video-analytics/blob/master/Serving/config.json>`_ by referring https://github.com/intel/video-analytics-serving/tree/master/tools/model_downloader
and have the downloaded model files placed in "/opt/intel/eii/models" 
directory.

.. code-block:: sh

   # Execute the builder.py script
   $ python3 buidler.py -f evas.yml

   # Create some necessary items for the service
   $ sudo mkdir -p /opt/intel/eii/models/

   # Build the docker containers
   $ docker-compose build

   # Start the docker containers
   $ docker-compose up -d

This repository provides the VA Serving pipeline needed for using a URI source
and sending the ingested frames using the EII MsgBus Publisher. The commands above
which create the, "models/", directory and the, "pipelines/", install needed
directories for the service to run and install the VA Serving pipeline.
