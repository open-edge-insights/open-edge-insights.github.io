Known issues
------------


* 
  OpcuaExport service has been validated with below 3rd party OPCUA client apps:


  * OPCUA CTT tool (https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/certification-test-tools/opc-ua-compliance-test-tool-uactt/) - Works well in both DEV and PROD modes
  * UaExpert (https://www.unified-automation.com/downloads/opc-ua-clients.html) - Works well in DEV mode only and with PROD mode, facing issues while trusting the self-signed certs
  * Integrated Objects (https://integrationobjects.com/sioth-opc/sioth-opc-unified-architecture/opc-ua-client/) - Works well in DEV mode only and with PROD mode, facing issues while trusting the self-signed certs

  However, the Prosys OPCUA client app(https://www.prosysopc.com/products/opc-ua-browser/) doesn't work both in DEV and PROD modes as it expects LDS(Local discovery server) to be implemented in the OPCUA Server to be able to discover\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
  server and LDS is not part of out OpcuaExport service now.
